Officer Reilly asked the driver if he needed an ambulance, at which point one was requested.  The driver returned to check on his wife who was now honking the horn.  The man came back to report that the child's head had now appeared.  Before Madison Fire/Rescue could respond, the baby had been delivered in the car with the assistance of the new father.  Madison Fire/Rescue arrived to provide medical attention and deliver the mother, baby and father to Meriter Hospital.  The family, from Sun Prairie already have two twin children.",

Officers attempted contact at the apartment, and discovered that the wanted subject, Quantaze D.Campbell, 07-06-1976, had fled the apartment via the window. Campbell climbed to the roof of the two story building, refusing officer orders to give himself up. Police established a perimeter around the building, and continued to give directives without avail. At one point, Campbell forced entry to the attic, subsequently entered the second floor hallway through the ceiling, and then several apartments. Campbell then reentered the attic through the ceiling, before returning to the roof. Officers evacuated residents on the second floor, while other officers responded to the roof. Several of the officers on the roof were tethered by ropes in the event Campbell should physically resist efforts to take him into custody. As police followed Campbell to the roof, Campbell fled to the roof of another building at 1114 Ann St. Campbell was able to reach the roof by climbing through a tree, whose canopy spanned the gap between the buildings. The incident was resolved peacefully when Campbell agreed to give himself up with the promise of a soda and cigarette.",

The Officers were injured by material from the exploding tire.  The vehicle then became dislodged from the ambulance and drove into a neighboring business parking lot.  Two Firefighters/Paramedics had to jump out of the way in order to avoid being struck by the vehicle.  At some point, the suspect got out of the vehicle and was apprehended by the Officers.  The vehicle continued to go in circles in the parking lot of the business.  A Firefighter was able to jump into the vehicle and shut it off.  The vehicle, a 2005 Nissan Altima, was severely damaged and had to be towed from the scene.  The Fire Department ambulance received damage in the area of impact but was driven from the scene.

Two officers noticed Hale, the alleged driver, walking on Allied Drive and told him to stop.  Hale refused the uniformed officer's request to stop and led them on a footchase.  Hale hid behind thick bushes before finally being apprehended at 8:38 p.m.",

As previously released, the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Bomb Squad rendered this package safe.  The person in custody, on unrelated charges, has a local history of planting suspicious materials in the Madison area and he is believed to be responsible for the mailbox incident on W. Doty at Broom St.  The materials were fashioned in such a way that would lead investigators to believe to be suspicious in nature.  Due to the Bomb Squad\u2019s training and experience, they determined that it needed to be rendered safe as all precautionary measures were taken.  After further analysis, it was learned that at this time, none of the three objects recovered on 1/11/06 were explosive in nature and not similar to the parking ramp pipe bombs.  Furthermore, it is believed that none of the objects found on 1/11/06 are connected to the comprehensive investigation surround the Dane County parking ramp pipe bombs.  At this point the investigation continues into the parking ramp pipe bombs.",

                        "Details": "On March 10th, 2006 at approximately 2:58a.m, Madison Police Officers responded to the 900 block of E. Dayton Street reference a person claiming to have almost been run over by a vehicle.  The victim David M. Minahan (22 year old male of Madison) stated he had been out with his friend/co-worker Ursula A. Ahrens (25 year old female of Beaver Dam, WI) at various bars in the Madison area when they both decided to come back to his residence for the evening.  Minahan knew that Ahrens had consumed alcohol on this date, and not only had he deemed himself the designated driver, but he also did not want Ahrens attempting to drive back to Beaver Dam.  An argument ensued between the two parties about the issue of driving, and Ahrens allegedly insisted on driving anyway.  Minahan happened to be in front of Ahrens vehicle when she decided to drive off and he was forced to jump on the hood of car; hanging on as tightly as he could so he would not fall off.  Minahan estimated the vehicle speeds to have reached 30mph, and he stated that the vehicle was traveling too fast for him to jump off safely.  The vehicle continued to drive on for several blocks (2/10ths of a mile) with Minahan hanging on to the hood of the car before the driver was forced to slow for crossing traffic.  This presented an opportunity for Minahan to jump safely from the hood of the car (performing a tuck and roll maneuver) and to contact the Madison Police Department to report the matter.Ahrens was stopped by the Madison Police Department in the 4800 block of American Parkway and arrested for 2nd Degree Reckless Endangering Safety and other alcohol/driving related charges.  While the Madison Police Department wants the public to be responsible in their choices to aid the community as a whole, we do not expect citizens to place themselves in harms way.  Please use caution when trying to deal with situations of this nature, and understand that the Madison Police Department offers its assistance in any matter of this nature.PO Howard Payne",

Also, detectives heard small children inside the living unit.  Precautions were made and the Madison Police Department's Emergency Response Team deployed.  Eventually phone negotiations were made with Homme, who was originally uncooperative.  The situation was resolved around 5:30 p.m. through negotiations and Homme was taken into custody without incident.",

The officer described Williams as \"Looking into the police car in a menacing way\" as Williams walked near the Open Pantry Convenience Store.  Minutes later, a 25 year old victim would be walking to a friends house near Pflaum Road and Camden Road.   Williams would confront the victim near this intersection demanding everything in his pockets.  The victim thought Williams was holding a silver colored gun underneath his shirt when the request for his property was made.  Williams then proceeds to head butt the victim after the victim stated he had nothing in his pockets.  As the victim fled the attempted robbery scene, he continued running back to the Open Pantry Store for assistance/refuge!  Williams chased the victim until he neared the store entrance, and was not seen again until police would contact him at his residence just a few short blocks away.An observant officer, with timely information about individuals in the area, led to an arrest in this situation.  The victim was not injured and lost no property whatsoever.  Officers were extremely efficient in their efforts, and this work reiterates the importance of community involvement; building bridges that ensures our city remains safe at all times.",

During the pursuit, speeds reached 100 m.p.h. and went though the eastern and northeastern parts of Dane County.  Road spikes were deployed and eventually Reilly drove over them causing his tires to deflate.  He continued to operate his vehicle at a lower rate of speed until he was boxed in by police squad cars and then gave up without further incident.  Prior to today's contact, Madison Detectives tried to have Reilly cooperate several times throughout the last few months and turn himself in.",

Police would soon find a 24-year-old male in need of medical attention due to having sustained severe facial lacerations and profuse bleeding.  This victim was allegedly attempting to deescalate a disturbance involving the two suspects listed above and a third unidentified person who was being chased.  When the victim intervened he became the focus of the violent behavior and was subsequently battered.It was reported to police that two suspects (later identified as Locatelli and Crawford Jr.) had both kicked and punched the victim several times to the head.  This victim was said to have lost consciousness and would be later taken to UW Hospital for treatment.  A window at a nearby establishment was broken leading up to the substantial battery and it is still unclear as to why/how the damage to property is connected to this scenario.Based on specific descriptions of the suspects, Police would soon located Locatelli and Crawford Jr. a short distance away and they were arrested based on identifications by witnesses of their alleged involvement.  The victim in this scenario was attempting to be a \"Good Samaritan\", but that did put him in a bad predicament.

The first responding officer reports that upon arrival the individual was compliant and sitting down in the hallway in just his underwear.  Before back-up officers arrived, the suspect became violent in pounding his body against the wall and eventually approached the sole officer.  That officer deployed the taser to the individual in which it gained momentary compliance.  The suspect continued chanting, encouraged pain, continued injuring himself and made aggressive moves toward that officer.  As another officer responded, the taser was deployed again and an officer went \"hands on\" to try and handcuff him.  The suspect struggled and other taser deployments occurred.  As more officers responded, the suspect was eventually arrested on the above charges.  Madison Police Officers recently went through in-depth training on \"excited delirium\" in which suspects who are naked oftentimes are on a drug high in which they feel extreme heat in which nothing can cool them off and where they seem immune to any pain they may inflict on themselves.  Responding to a police call with naked individuals, acting violently, can be an extremely dangerous situation.",

The girls went to the play area of Lincoln school.  Xicay-Garcia moved his vehicle and parked to watch the girls play.  Xicay-Garcia then circled the school at least four times watching the girls.  The girls became fearful and contacted a male friend, 11, who confronted Xicay-Garcia who was now in the school parking lot.

Upon gaining probable cause for an arrest, officers grabbed Eisele's arm as he ashed his cigarette.  Eisele resisted and a friend inside pushed against the door in an attempt to free Eisele and prevent officers from making an arrest.  Eventually officers dynamically entered the door and confronted a resistive Eisele and Bormett.  The actively resisting suspects were decentralized and arrested.  During this process a German shepherd entered the area from within the house and bit an officer in the knee area.  More officers responded and Eisele and Bormett were arrested.  Other juveniles were cited at the party for underage alcohol consumption.  Eisele and Bormett were transported to the Dane County Jail.",

Washington Ave.  A perimeter was set up around the house and numerous attempts to make contact with the suspect inside failed.  Officers exhausted reasonable means to contact Coster, as they had reason to believe he was inside.  A contingent of on-duty Emergency Response Team personnel was assembled.  The team entered through the front door and apprehended Costo immediately, without further incident.  Coster is in the Dane County Jail.  The success of this bank robber arrest is credited to a number of officers.  It should be noted the excellent quality of the bank photos.  After other bank robbery photos were only showing the tops of suspects heads, or were of worse quality, MPD suggested altering the angle of the camera and upgrading the quality to several banks.  Amcore followed our suggestions and the photos taken were very helpful in identifying Coster.",

Officers immediately noticed a puncture wound & blood to the thigh of the victim (Coy), and immediately summoned Madison Fire Rescue for treatment and transport to a local hospital.  The acquainted parties seemed to have gotten into an argument where Musillami got extremely upset, and while holding a switchblade knife to the throat of Coy, continued to make death threats as he physically battered her.  Coy managed to jump out of an apartment window with no shoes, and ran to a nearby street sweeper that happened to be operational near Park Street and Buick Street.  The victim refused to exit the street sweeper vehicle after having surprised the operator, and demanded to be taken to the Madison Police South District Station; where police would later talk to her about this incident. The victim reported having been struck at least 50 times, and stated Musillami denied her the opportunity to leave the assault location.  She also reported being stabbed in the thigh by Musillami after he allegedly had \"Gone into a rage\".  Police obtained detailed information as to the location of Musillami and responded immediately to his residence.  Musillami could not give police any reasonable explanation for the numerous injuries the victim sustained on this date.  Musillami would later be arrested on felony charges (listed above). Coy was treated at an area hospital for non-life threatening injuries and released without further incident.  PO Howard Payne",

The suspect was located and charged police with a knife.  The K-9 was deployed to decentralize the suspect.  This still remains under investigation by the Madison Police Department this morning.  The suspect's identity will be released after the initial investigation, as he has not been booked into the jail yet. ****UPDATE****  The victim reports waking up to a strange taste in her mouth and noticed Mulvihill standing over her with a weapon.  As the victim screamed, Mulvihill fled on foot.  There was a unique chemical odor in the room that was not present prior to the victim falling asleep.  The chemical residue on the victim and her pillow were taken to a lab for further testing to determine its identity.",

Both Shidell and Derrick Jay Booker were taken from the vehicle at gunpoint.  Both Booker & Shidell were arrested and booked into the DCJ on the above listed charges.The victim, 19-year-old female of Madison, in this matter sustained two individual lacerations to the top portion of her right hand (ring/smallest finger), and was treated at a local hospital for those injuries.

Johnson in the 2800 Block of Moland Street reference a felony probation violation.  After checking a residence where Johnson was allegedly thought to be, Johnson would drive past officers attempting to flee arrest and a high-speed pursuit would commence.  This pursuit would continue through neighborhoods in and around this area for approximately 9 minutes, and based on due regard for safety, Police would terminate the pursuit to keep the public safe from the erratic driving behavior of Johnson running a number of stop signs in his attempt to elude police!Police having knowledge that this pursuit and contact with Johnson had proven unsuccessful just weeks before, attempted to contact Johnson on 5/27/2008 shortly after 9PM based on surveillance and the probability that Johnson was once again in the area (2800 Moland St).  Police would stop a vehicle that was connected to Johnson and find him hiding from view in the front passenger seat of the car.  Conscientious officers made an arrest after a \"Lengthy delay\" by Johnson to exit the vehicle.  The driver of the vehicle was subsequently charged with obstructing for not providing information to police about where Johnson was located after being asked specific questions.This case shows restraint by officers in the initial pursuit, keeping in mind the best interest of public safety as a number one priority.  It also reflects a commitment by officers to continue to work minute pieces of information until the case could be furthered; eventually ending in the arrest of an individual with no intentions of compliance!PO Howard Payne",

In fact, a Madison Police detective was driving by at the time the clerk ran out. She flagged him down. He called for backup, just as the suspect came out of the store. The suspect indicated he had entered the store for the purpose of filling out a job application. He said he had a bandana covering everything but his eyes because there was a bad odor outside. He is accused of trying to open the cash register, and dropping a BB pistol by an outdoor garbage can. He said he got rid of the gun because he was scared responding officers might shoot him.",

For most of this past winter, however, many late payment notices have not been mailed, at least not out until now.  In early December, the Wisconsin Dept of Transporation \"upgraded\" the computer systems that maintain the vehicle registration and license files.  When this change was implemented the week of December 13, MPD found that DOT had changed the data formats sent back to law enforcement agencies who make electronic inquires of these files. Subsequently automated programs written by MPD's records mangement system vendor to identify license plates and VIN#'s with unpaid parking tickets no longer worked.  Over the past two months, MPD's vendor and MPD Information Management & Technology staff have worked to re-write the interface application, and just recently began sending out large volumes of late payment notices.    MPD wishes to advise the public, particularly their \"repeat customers\" who have received several parking tickets over the winter, that the U.S. Post Office will be delivering several thousand notices over the next few weeks as we attempt to get our late payment processing back on track.",

Extra officer patrols will start on May 23, 2005.  These patrols will occur on various dates and times throughout the campaign period.  The focus on the extra patrols is to intensify enforcement of child passenger safety and safety belt laws to help save lives.  In 2004, WI Department of Transportation reported that seatbelt use varies more than 7% across the state.  The Madison area is highest at 75.6 % and the Milwaukee area is lowest at 68.1%.  Other research shows occupants of vans (80.5%)were more likely to use their seatbelts than occupants of pickup trucks (58.2%).  Females were also more likely to wear their safety belt than males.  The national seatbelt use, based on last year\u0019s successful Click It or Ticket campaign, was 80%. During the mobilization officers will concentrate on safety belt use by all vehicle occupants, regardless of age.  The Madison Police Departments wants to increase the use of safety belts up to the national average during this campaign.  Although the public knows it should buckle up, many people don\u0019t take the 2 seconds needed to so.  Increased enforcement, with aggressive publicity highlighting enforcement efforts, is an effective tool to increase compliance.",

The handgun was located by the weapons screeners in a briefcase.Madison Police Officers took the subject into custody.  Investigation determined the weapon involved was a facsimile and not a real firearm, although it looked exactly like a real semi-automatic pistol.  The weapon and some lookalike ammunition were confiscated and held as evidence.  The subject who was detained indicated he is a landlord and was concerned for his safety and, therefore, decided to carry this lookalike weapon.  He indicated he momentarily forgot the item was in his briefcase and realized immediately as it went through the screening machine that there would be a problem.  He was extremely cooperative and released after being given a court date for June 6, 2005.  The above-listed charge is a forfeiture violation with a maximum penalty of a $500.00 fine.",

K9 officers have helped located dangerous felony suspects, missing or lost persons, and valuable evidence.  K9 officers routinely assist patrol officers search buildings and track and apprehend potentially dangerous suspects, greatly improving the safety of patrol officers on these types of calls.  K9 officers have also made over 20 educational presentations and demonstrations in the Madison area.K9 officers have been directly involved in locating over 81 pounds of marijuana and 856 grams of cocaine.  They have located several dangerous weapons including a 9 mm, a 357 and a .380 handgun, all loaded and associated with drug trafficking.  In addition to removing drugs with a street value in excess of $140,000 from Madison streets, K9 officers have resulted in the seizure of over $25,000 in cash and 1 SUV.Although the K9 officers have been very active so far, additional K9 officers are needed to meet the increasing demand for the services these teams provide.  Madison Police currently have just four K9 officers and patrol officers and sergeants have often requested the assistance of a K9 officer only to be told they are not working that day or shift, or are already helping other officers.  The Madison Police Department hopes to add an additional three K9 teams but with an estimated cost of $50,000 per K9, all funded by donations through a non-profit organization, they are looking for the community\u2019s help.  Anyone interested in making donations or supporting the Madison Police Department K9 program can go to www.capitalk9s.org or contact Lt. Vic Wahl or Sergeant Chris Boyd.",

Please note more information will be available tomorrow, Monday, 10/31/2005. \"While a solid plan and good execution resulted in improvement, Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and Madison Police Chief Noble Wray agreed that it is time for the Madison Community to take a hard look at whether Halloween on State Street should continue.Two of the four measures of success established prior to the event were met - there were no serious injuries or major property damage. But for the fourth year in a row, police had to wear hard gear and deploy pepper spray to clear a disorderly and dangerous crowd.'The Madison Police Department and other law enforcement agencies deserve credit for acting quickly to prevent injury and property damage', Cieslewicz said. 'But when we spend approximately $350.000, when 447 (178 Fri, 269 Sat) people are arrested, when Detox is filled, we can't characterize this as a successful event.'Chief Wray was proud of the fact the event was executed according to plan, yet also questions its future. 'I was proud of the officers and commanders exection of the comprehensive plan. Although we have plans in place, for the fourth year in a row we have people coming to State Street to cause disruption and put my officer's safety at risk.'",

This subject had been seen by witnesses pouring liquid on top of his engine and underneath his vehicle to make it seem as if his vehicle was experiencing mechanical problems.  He then used his creative misfortune to get unsuspecting bystanders to give him money that would allegedly aid him in repairing his car.  People throughout the City of Madison should be extremely careful when approaching individuals they do not know, and although this is the season of giving people should not actively give money to individuals that are unfamiliar to them.

This person allegedly dropped something into the manhole cover hole.  Law enforcement officers and investigators from several agencies responded to what was determined to be a suspicious item.  The Dane County Bomb Squad render this item safe and collected this suspicious object and learned of a second one on Webster Street.  That item was also rendered safe and is in law enforcement possession.  Around 2:30 p.m. a U.S. Postal employee alerted law enforcement to another suspicious item in a mailbox on the corner of Doty St and Broom St.  This item went through the proper protocols of the Dane County Sheriff's Bomb Squad to render it safe.  All three items from today do not appear to have the same components as the ongoing comprehensive investigation regarding the pipe bombs found in the Dane County parking ramp.",

The man had called 911 and said that people were trying to kidnap him.  The caller verbally identified himself as Victor Montero-Diaz.\u00b7\tUpon officer\u2019s arrival, a station employee confirmed a man had been in the bathroom for about 20 minutes.  The officers tried to get Montero-Diaz to come out of the bathroom, but he refused.  Officers obtained a key and unlocked the door.  Montero-Diaz came out of the bathroom and rushed the uniformed officers.   Officer Kellogg deployed a taser that had no effect.\u00b7\tThe officers continued to physically struggle with the man. They realized the man had a large knife in his hand.  During the struggle, Officer Harless suffered serious bite wounds to both arms.  Officer Kellogg was stabbed once in the right bicep.  They were unable to subdue or disarm the man who continued to come at the officers brandishing the knife.  Officer Kellogg drew and fired 3 rounds.  \u00b7\tA bystander coming to aid the officers was hit by one of the rounds, or a ricochet of one of the rounds.   Officer Kellogg provided basic medical aid to him until paramedics arrived.  The by-stander was treated and released from University Hospital.  Officer Harless attempted life-saving aid to Montero-Diaz.  \u00b7\tBoth Officer Harless and Kellogg were treated at Meriter Hospital.  Officer Harless was treated and released.  Officer Kellogg was admitted, but released early this afternoon.A number of interviews have taken place and will continue with both witnesses to the incident, and those who knew the deceased.  The investigation at this point leads us to believe Montero-Diaz was suffering from some hallucinations or delusions just prior to this incident.  This case remains under investigation.",

Segundo, aunque estos rumores son falsos, vale la pena aprovechar esta oportunidad para nuevamente recalcar que el Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Madison tiene una tradici\u00f3n y tambien un reglamento interno que claramente destacan que nuestros oficiales no indagan sobre el estado migratorio de los miembros de nuestra comunidad.  Esto es parte de la filosof\u00eda de nuestro gobierno municipal de que asuntos de ley migratoria son asuntos primordialmente del gobierno federal, y que actuar de otra forma pondr\u00eda en riesgo la importante relaci\u00f3n de confianza que siempre queremos cultivar con toda la comunidad.A continuaci\u00f3n les env\u00edo una comunicaci\u00f3n directamente del Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Madison relacionada a este tema.Atentamente,Dave CieslewiczALCALDE----------------------------------------------------------------El Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Madison no ha asistido en la planificaci\u00f3n o ejecuci\u00f3n de redadas migratorias por las autoridades federales.

Dear friends:In the last few days, rumors have been circulating in our community that law enforcement and federal officials have been conducting raids aimed at capturing undocumented immigrants.  First, we want to let you know that all sources within our reach indicate that this information is false, and that no such operations are taking place in our community.  Secondly, although these rumors are false, it is worth taking this opportunity to emphasize again that the Madison Police Department has a tradition and also a formal policy that clearly provides that our officers will not inquire into the immigration status of our residents.  This is part of a philosophy of our municipal government that immigration law matters are primarily a federal government matter, and that to act otherwise would jeopardize the important trust relationship that we endeavor to cultivate with our community.  I include below a communication from the Madison Police Department related to this matter.Sincerely,Dave CieslewiczMAYOR --------------------------------------------------------------------------The Madison Police Department has not assisted in any planning or execution of Immigration raids by federal authorities.  Concerns have been raised to the Madison Police Department about potential involvement and it is our intention to make it clear that we have not participated.   \u201cI have heard of fear in the Hispanic community that our officers are assisting Immigration officials with deportation measures,\u201d stated Madison Police Chief Noble Wray.  \u201cOur policy clearly indicates that our department will not notify federal authorities of one\u2019s immigration status when dealing with local police matters.\u201d   Per Madison Police Department policy: \u201cThe Madison Police Department will cooperate with the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) as it would with any other law enforcement agency.  However, it is the policy of this department that its officers shall not arrest or detain any person solely for a suspected violation of immigration laws, except upon the request of INS.\u201d \u201cOfficers shall not ask any person to produce an Alien Registration Card (Green Card) or other immigration document except when assisting the INS.\u201d",

Twenty-two stops were made in using only the \"shadow\" car and not laser or radar.  From these stops, twenty-six citations were issued.  The first two stops led officers all the way to the Interstate.  The shadow car was trailing a vehicle traveling 75 m.p.h. on the Beltline and eventually 80 m.p.h. on the interstate.  While trailing this vehicle, another vehicle passed both the shadow and suspect vehicle, eventually reaching 90 m.p.h.  Officers were able to pull over both vehicles.  Most of the citations were for speed, following too close and unsafe lane changes.  This will be an ongoing enforcement effort on the Beltline.",

One of the purposes of this new ordinance was to efficiently use police resources, while maintaining public safety.  The process for this ordinance included a lengthy study (illustrating how over 95% of the alarm calls police respond to are false), public hearings and support from the Common Council.   During the process, the Madison Police Department listened to concerns from the community, businesses and alders and supported changes to the evolving ordinance.  In response, the Madison Police Department worked with Council members and made adjustments related to the ordinance, which are outlined below:-As practiced before the Verified Response Ordinance, Madison Police Officers will still respond, unconditionally, to all residential alarms.  These alarms make up 12% of all false alarms.  -Madison Police will respond to any commercial burglar alarm once verification takes place indicating a crime or irregularity is or may have taken place.  -When a mechanically activated commercial burglar alarm is received by the 911 Center, the information will be broadcast over police radio to officers working in the vicinity.  There will be no expectation that a police response will occur.  A police response is generally based on the number of circumstances from call-load, frequency of the business's false alarms, proximity, availability and other situations.  -Madison Police will continue to respond to any human activated alarm whether it originates from an individual, a residence or a business.  Panic, duress and robbery alarms are NOT affected by the ordinance change.  The Madison Police Department will provide a year-end report of this new ordinance to the Madison Common Council.",

Although frustrating, there is little, if any follow-up the Madison Police Department can provide.  The latest possible scam comes from Canada, with the same theme.  An individual selling their vehicle on-line is told that a Church in Canada has decided to purchase the vehicle.  In doing so, they send a \"check\" for more than the asking price (to handle what are believed to be taxes, shipping and handling, etc) and then eventually ask for a returned cashier's check from the seller, typically for thousands of dollars.  To our knowledge, this does not appear to be a legitimate cause and citizens should be cautious of strangers sending you \"money\" and then asking for money in return.",

                        "Details": "On Sunday July 15th at 5:44 p.m. Madison Police were asked to contact a woman who was pulled over on East Washington Ave. earlier in the day (around 5:30 a.m.) She said she noticed flashing lights on a vehicle behind her, but was not sure they were squad car lights. She eventually did pull over, and reports that the blinking lights then became a blinding white light after the trailing vehicle stopped. She says a white male, wearing a light brown shirt, approached the driver's side of her car. The suspect never identified himself as a police officer, but began to ask her a volley of law enforcement type questions like, \"do you know how fast you were going?\" The woman says the man never asked for her identification, but did ask where she worked. The entire experience left her feeling very nervous. It should be noted that in the majority of traffic stops in Madison an officer would be wearing a full uniform. That uniform would include a badge and a department patch. Also a squad car should have lots of red and blue lights. Also, upon request, an officer should be able to produce a department issued identification card.(This report was just typed, and not discovered by the PIO until this date (July 24)",

The objective of the DSI Special Ops were on alcohol related behaviors, crime and disorder between 9pm and 3:00 a.m. over the long Labor Day holiday weekend in the downtown area. In addition to regular patrol staffing, the Central District Community Policing Team and nearly 200 hours of officer overtime were used to make 157 arrests for a wide variety of local ordinance and criminal offenses:  \t30-Aug\t31-Aug\t1-Sep\t2-Sep\tOpen Intox\t3\t4\t13\t2\tDepositing Human Waste\t3\t2\t12\t2\tUnderage Alcohol\t7\t8\t5\t2\tDispensing Liquor Violations (Parties)\t43\t22\t\t\tMisc Liquor Law Violation\t\t\t2\t\tDrug Offense\t\t\t1\t\tCriminal Damage\t\t\t1\t\tDisorderly Conduct\t\t3\t6\t\tObstructing/Resisting Arrest\t1\t1\t3\t\tOMVWI\t\t1\t\t\tPed/Traffic Violations\t\t\t1\t\tNoise Violations\t3\t1\t\t\tDetox Conveyances\t1\t\t3\t\tOther\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t61\t42\t48\t6\t** 157(*8 different house parties in campus area ranging from 40 to over 100 underage attendees).(** This total represents what is known at present; final totals from this past weekend will be higher).The majority of the arrests at the house parties were UW Madison students.  However, less than 50% of all other DSI arrests in the State, Langdon, University Ave area were found to be UW students.  Over 30% of these DSI arrests were found not to be college students at all but older adults, alumni, out of town visitors, etc.).  The Central District intends to continue to execute DSI special operations over the next several weekends focusing on alcohol related crime and disorder. The Central District asks that young adults visiting the downtown entertainment district be aware of their environment, watch out for the safety of themselves and friends, drink responsibly and simply be good citizens. Downtown Madison should be safe and fun for everyone!  For further information regarding MPD's role in the Downtown Safety Initiative, please contact Central District Operations Lieutenant Joe Balles at 575-5005.",

                        "Details": "It was nearly one year ago that 22-year-old Kelly Nolan \u2013 a cherished daughter, sister, and friend - was last seen alive. As we approach the June 23rd anniversary, Kelly\u2019s family and friends would like to join with the Madison Police Department in renewing requests for your help.Kelly had been socializing with friends in Madison\u2019s downtown on Friday night, June 22, 2007.  At some point Kelly departed their company after deciding to stay out a bit longer. Detectives have talked with several people who had contact with Kelly later Friday night and into the early morning hours of Saturday, June 23, 2007. The investigators believe at some point Kelly left the Madison area \u2013 either consensually, or against her will - with someone who has yet to be identified.On July 9, 2007 Kelly\u2019s body was found in a wooded area in the Town of Dunn just north of the Village of Oregon. Since that time there has been an active criminal investigation to determine who brought Kelly to that location.During  the past year approximately 590 individuals have been contacted by the Madison Police Department in regard to this investigation. Nearly 200 tips have been followed up on, and around 1,200 pages of reports have been generated. As Kelly\u2019s family prepares to honor and celebrate her memory on this first anniversary of her passing, Madison Police detectives would like to ask people to consider whether they have noticed any sudden lifestyle changes in persons with whom they are acquainted, changes which would have surfaced since the time of Kelly Nolan\u2019s disappearance on June 23, 2007.Some of these changes might include, but are not be limited to:a.\tRelocation away from the Madison area on little or no notice.b.\tUnexpectedly taking or seeking a new job prompting a move from the area.c.\tOther abrupt lifestyle changes might include:i.\tSuddenly joining the military or other organization which would involve relocation or extensive travelii.\tQuitting school without prior problems or noticeiii.\tChanging schools without good reason.d.\tIt could be a person is showing unusually keen interest in the news and Kelly\u2019s case.i.\tPaying excessive amounts of time and attention to Kelly\u2019s death. ii.   There might be speculation of the events of the crime.ii.\tAlternately, we would be interested in knowing about people who have been                                                    conspicuously ignoring the story or changing the subject when it comes upe.\tThere could also be a change in a person\u2019s emotional or psychological behaviors;i.\tDisruption of sleep pattern.ii.\tReoccurring dreams.iii.\tExcessive drinking.iv.\tDepression or crying episodes.v.\tChange in grade or job performance. Investigators would like members of the public to think about such things.For Kelly\u2019s family and friends it is impossible to express in words just how difficult the past year has been, as they have spent countless hours seeking answers to Kelly\u2019s tragic death. Her mother, Mary Jane, wrote the following in an attempt to provide at least some perspective on her sorrow:I think about having Kelly taken physically out of my life every day, that is so physically and emotionally challenging I cry, want to work myself to exhaustion in my yard, pray the strength to believe there may be a day I can cope with better thoughts about the best things I shared with Kelly instead of nightmares about the tragedy.To sum up my sadness, daily I wish I would see her again, I wish she was with the family enjoying the good times we make with the love and joy of having one another to laugh with, talk about the good old days and the things Kelly said and did that reflected her gift to live each day to the fullest. Kelly always picked me up when I was down, talked with me about her goals and dreams, and also shared her challenges.I thank God; Candice, Brian and April (Kelly\u2019s sisters & brother) have given me more than I could ever imagine helping me live with the loss of Kelly. Each has a special message for me, which focuses on the positive and putting the negative situation behind me. I want to avoid thoughts that keep me wondering who did it, why, and how they feel every day knowing they not only took Kelly from our family, but also a part of life she shared with everyone she knew.Since my tears are falling now I know it would be extremely difficult to extend these words publicly to those who would like to know how I feel. Perhaps if the murderer or someone who knows who did it, could see how much pain continues to be with me daily, facts would be forwarded to Crime Stoppers.Mary Jane NolanKelly\u2019s Mom",

Shortly after some wood was also being thrown from the alley on to the street, causing a safety hazzard.  The Sergeant confronted the individual inquiring what he was doing.  The Sergeant attempted to detain the male who would not cooperate and fled on foot.  A foot chase ensued and the male crossed E. Wilson and then John Nolen Drive near the east of the Monona Convention Center.  More officers responded to the scene and witnessed the male out on the thin ice of Lake Monona.  Officers tried to convince the male to return to shore due to the thin ice, but he refused and kept running eastbound about 100 yards off shore toward open water.  Officers tried to illuminate the male with their flashlights until he ran too far.  The Madison Fire Department's Lake Rescue Team and the Dane County Sheriff's Office airboat also assited in the search for the male on the lake. At this point the male subject has not been located and the search will continue today.  **UPDATE**  On 02-03-06, at 530pm, Justin J.

Officers observed an extremely large crowd, estimated to be 100-200 people, gathering and moving in between the 2300-2400 blocks of Allied Drive.  Officers ascertained that there were two potential problems within the group.  Allegedly there was a youthful person carrying a handgun.  Secondly, two individuals were arguing all day and were about to fight, hence the large group congregating.  Several officers walked through the group to gain intelligence and break up the crowd.  This tactic had little effect as the crowd was very agitated.  Concerned adults were coming out of their apartments because they also sensed the hostility.  Eventually, Hoffman was arrested as part of the cause for the disturbance.  Additionally, officers learned the whereabouts of the 13 year-old male believed to have a gun.  Upon seeing the youth, officers noticed the apartment he fled to, in which the tenants said they did not know him.  Officers, acting in due regard confronted the individual who was now in a strangers apartment, believed to have a weapon.  Officers kicked in the door to chase the youth who now jumped out of the window.  Several officers engaged in a foot-chase and eventually caught the youth.  He was taken to Juvenile Reception, while Hoffman was taken to jail.  Officers noted that the Allied Drive neighborhood was significantly calmer after this disturbance.",

Mifflin St.  While walking through the backyard, there were several people drinking alcohol nearby.  The victim felt uneasy about walking through the backyards and put her canister of pepper-spray in her hand to walk with as she felt someone was following her.  A male subject caught up to her and grabbed her shoulder area.  The victim initially struggled and then turned and deployed pepper-spray on the subject's face.  The subject ran one way and the victim ran another way.  This incident is under investigation by the Madison Police Department.  Anyone with further information is advised to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.  Callers can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a cash reward.",

                        "Details": "On 11/08/06 at approximately 11:29am, Educational Resource Officer (ERO) requested emergency backup at Memorial High School reference a belligerent parent that was out of control.  Upon arrival, it was determined that a 17-year-old male subject, who was not a student of the school, had been taken into custody by the ERO and was being cited/released on a municipal violation of possessing tobacco products.  Jacquelyn L. Lightfoot (parent of the 17-year-old male)  was made aware of the arrest scenario and responded to Memorial High School.    Lightfoot made her way to the office of the ERO and began to verbally attack the officer for the police action he was involved in concerning the 17-year-old male.  Lightfoot continually escalated her actions towards the officer and was told many times to calm down and cease her physical approach; as she demanded her son be released from custody immediately.  The ERO was then surrounded by Lightfoot and her two daughters in a confined area, and deeming Lightfoot the greatest threat, a Taser was utilized by the ERO to deescalate this threat to a manageable level.  It should be noted that the officer verbalized and used a physical separation technique before using the Taser as his last resort.  Jacquelyn L. Lightfoot and her two daughters were all arrested on charges of Disorderly Conduct and Resisting/Obstructing A Police Officer.  The situation that occurred was an isolated event that did not place the school in any harm at any time.  School officials were quick to act in this scenario, and it was resolved quickly after police arrived on scene.  It is understandable that parents would be concerned about the welfare of their children, but school officials and police would expect that parents would be appropriate in utilizing the correct mode of conflict resolution.  This is a case that all involved parties did not envision, but concerns by any interested person must be dealt with in an appropriate manner if the educational environment is to remain conducive to that of learning.PO Howard Payne",

As they were walking home, they noticed four females following them and were quickly approaching.  At one point the twelve year-old asked the sixteen year old if she had any money.  Sensing that she was going to be robbed or beaten up, the sixteen year old told her eight year-old sister to run home, which she did.  The victim was pushed to the ground and taunted as she did not have any money to give up.  The four girls ran off and the victim called police.  An officer made contact with two of the girls in the 5700 block of Russett Rd and the twelve year-old was eventually charged and brought to Juvenile Reception.",

The PEO began to walk away but was followed and harassed verbally by Henter and a companion.  The two followed the PEO who completed his work and was trying to avoid the individuals.  As they reached Mifflin St, Henter struck the PEO on the back, with a fist.  Henter was later arrested on Gilman St without further incident.",

He says another car, with five men inside, pulled up, and someone hurled a beer can at his car. Angry, he and his brother followed the offending vehicle to Camden Road. There parties from both cars got out, and a fistfight broke out. At some point the victim's brother noticed the five they were fighting had knives. Additionally, another individual, apparently a friend of the five arrived on scene with what looked like a rifle. At this point the brothers decided to get back in their car and leave the area. It was after that the victim realized he had been stabbed. His brother drove him to the hospital where he was treated for non-life threatening cuts.",

                        "Details": "On July 30th, shortly before 4:30 p.m., Madison Police were called to the Madison Metro bus headquarters on E. Washington Avenue to talk with a Metro supervisor about possible criminal charges against a Metro driver for an incident that took place on the driver's bus Sunday (July 29) afternoon. Officers would learn that the driver, Kris Burke, became angry after a passenger informed him that another rider had urinated in the back of the bus. Burke thought (and Metro officials say he was told)  the culprit was a guy who had just gotten off the bus. The passenger that Burke believed responsible for soiling the bus then tried to get back on a short time later. He was waiting at a stop after going to the Walgreen's on Verona Road to pick up some items (a water cooler, two pairs shorts, & toilet paper) for his wife. Driver Burke refused to let him back on the bus. The man, who had his wallet out and in hand, grabbed a hold of a bus mirror as the bus sped off heading for the West Beltline. The would-be passenger said he feared for his life as he clung to the mirror. He thought if he jumped a car might hit him. During his \"ride\", which he estimates was 12 to 14 blocks, he dropped his wallet. Video shows the bus reached speeds of around 35 M.P.H. The victim decided to jump off before the bus got up to the beltline. Metro officials say the bus had stopped when he made his departure. The victim complained of a sore back after making the leap. He never found his wallet, and by the time he returned to the bus stop the items he had purchased for his wife were gone. The victim denies he was responsible for the mess on the bus, and bus video is inconclusive",

The officer ended up struggling with the man, and was backed up a short time later by other officers who were aided in getting him restrained. The man's female roommate reported that he had attacked her shortly before his encounter with the officer, and she (the roommate) said he was acting completely out of character. She did not know if he had taken some type of drug. The man is at a local hospital where he is being observed by medical staff. During the struggle with officers he pulled out hair from one, and bit another. He has not been arrested at this time, but could face tentative charges upon discharge from the hospital.",

An employee said the suspect was \"hitting on\" all females entering the store. The witness said the guy was following women around trying to get their phone numbers, and talking about having some sort of relationship with them. At one point the suspect sat on the checkout counter as one woman attempted to make her purchase. A store employee told him to hop down, and he responded by unleashing a barrage of obscenities, some of which were directed at the woman. That\u2019s when police were called. When one officer arrived the suspect was sitting on another woman's SUV, which was parked at the pumps. Its owner was inside paying for gas, and indicated she would like the man removed from her hood. As police confronted him he made a \"very angry-looking face\" just before being handcuffed. Several individually wrapped packages of marijuana, and more than $150 in cash, were found in his pockets.",

Police would gather information through the dispatching center reference a white Chevy Impala leaving the restaurant, and a traffic stop would be made just blocks away from the establishment.  Police would contact an Anthony W. Dorsey and he would advise \u201cHe was just trying to leave the restaurant and had done nothing wrong.\u201d  Officers interviewed witnesses that stated Dorsey had been doing pushups inside of the business just moments before confronting a 29-year-old male of Madison and challenging him to a fight outside.  When the victim did not accept the fight invitation, Dorsey spit in the face of the victim.  The victim held a knife in his hand as a defensive measure, but the antics would continue with Dorsey picking up a chair at one point.  Several people inside of the restaurant attempted to calm Dorsey, but it was not until the quick thinking victim pretended that he was going outside of the restuarant that Dorsey found himself on the other side of a locked door.After police stopped Dorsey a short distance away, he identified himself by an alias and was arrested.  Dorsey was not happy about the way in which things were progressing, and resisted police having been placed in restraints at one point before he would kick and damage the patrol squad door.  Police searched the vehicle the Dorsey was operating, and found marijuana and drug paraphernalia.  Dorsey was conveyed to the Dane County Jail, and the Movement Team was requested to deal with the violent manner in which Dorsey was acting.  It is unclear as to why an altercation of this nature started in the first place, but the behavior of Dorsey was less than appropriate based on witnesses\u2019 accounts.  Alcohol was also thought to be a contributing factor.PO Howard Payne",

A responding officer discovered a small propane bottle with a flame emitting from it had been left at a construction site. The propane bottle had been wrapped in tape, and had some sort of fuse attached. It's believed those who placed it had hoped for some type of explosion, which did not happen. Neighbors observed a small black four-door car, possibly a Honda or Nissan, driving quickly from the area. They say it may have had a specialty Green Bay Packer license plate. Witnesses thought there were three people inside the car, and that the driver was possibly female.Anyone with information is urged to call Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.",

Upon arrival, deputies learned that a 43 year-old female staff member driving a light blue 2003 Dodge Caravan (WI license plate UKJ696; registered to the Rock Valley program) had driven up to a parolee who had recently been transferred to the facility and was standing in the facility\u2019s driveway entrance near Sunny Lane.  The parolee, John F. Perry (M/B; 04/08/67; 5-9; 140 lbs), forced his way into the vehicle and then tried to have the employee drive him away from the facility.  A struggle for control of the vehicle ensued.  The employee was eventually forced out of the vehicle while it was stationary on Sunny Lane.  Perry then fled westbound in the van toward USH 51.  Town of Beloit EMS transported the Rock Valley employee to Beloit Hospital for evaluation and initial indications are that she sustained bruises and muscle strains as a result of the incident.Perry is on parole, reportedly as a result of a past substantial battery conviction.

The victim in this matter was traveling westbound on East Washington Avenue near Mendota Street when a vehicle driven by Emmanuel Juarez pulled out directly in front of the victim.  The victim passes Juarez\u2019s vehicle and just minutes later, Juarez would use the driver\u2019s side of his vehicle (1989 Toyota Corolla) to ram the passenger side of the victim\u2019s vehicle.  This startled the victim, but Juarez would drive off, continuing westbound on East Washington Avenue to North Street.  The victim followed Juarez and both parties would stop again in the 400 block of North Street.  Juarez would take a 2nd opportunity and proceeded to ram the opposite side of the victim\u2019s vehicle.  Juarez drove away once again and went to the BP Gas Station located on Commercial Avenue.  Juarez would immediately get out of his vehicle and take his licenses plates off of his car.  Just seconds before police would arrive, Juarez and two passengers of his car would flee the scene into a field directly behind this gas station.  Police would give pursuit and detain all parties.  Juarez admitted to striking the victim\u2019s vehicle due to \u201cBeing angry/upset over being passed by the victim.\u201d  Due to officers having difficulty locating the missing license plate, a Canine Officer was summoned and the plate was located near 2618 Scofield Street.  This was an outstanding effort on the part of the victim and officers.  This was a rather dangerous situation where a vehicle was intentionally used to cause damage/harm to another, and these types of scenarios potentially have unintended consequences for bystanders/pedestrians.PO Howard PayneMadison Police Department",

A six-year-old girl was on a tag-along bike that was attached to her dad's bicycle. The 37-year-old father was going to cross Monroe Street at Chapman Street with hopes of pedaling onto Arbor Drive. As he and his daughter were heading across the street a car turned left from Arbor Drive on to Monroe Street. The father yelled out, but it was too late, the '98 Ford Taurus struck the tag-along sending his daughter tumbling into the street. She struck the pavement with enough force to knock off her bicycle helmet. At first the little girl could not breathe. Her dad leaped to her aid and could hear from the driver state, \"Oh ----!\" as he drove off. Nearby witnesses signaled for the motorist to stop, but he did not. Another motorist followed the suspect and got his license plate. Officers took this information and went to the man's residence where he was arrested. Madison Fire Rescue responded and provided medical assistance to the girl. She did not require a trip to the hospital.",

Pursuant to investigation by Madison Police officers and detectives, Allen was charged with First Degree Intentional Homicide, and booked into the Dane County Jail. No other suspects are believed involved, and it is not believed there is any further danger to the community.UPDATE:The Madison Police Department continues its investigation into the homicide on 3/7/05 on Cottage Grove Rd.  Shortly after the initial dispatch, that a person had been stabbed with a knife, Madison Police Officers were able to arrest DeWayne K. Allen.  Mr. Allen has been cooperative with investigators and is now charged with First Degree Intentional Homicide.  Mr. Allen was transported to the Dane County Jail without incident.  In addition, the knife used for the homicide was located and is now in police possession.  Although the motive for the homicide is still being learned, investigators believe this resulted from a heated argument between the two individuals.  The victim is a 41-year old white male who resided in Madison.  The victim was transported to UW Hospital where the Coroner pronounced his death.  Madison police do not believe the two males lived together.  Both individuals had numerous contacts with law enforcement over the years.

On Tuesday July 10 a team of forensic experts worked the recovery scene along Schneider Drive in the area of where yesterday's body was found. In addition, another team of Madison Police Officers and Detectives went shoulder to shoulder, on their hands and knees, inspecting a grassy area near the woods where the body was located. By mid-afternoon the body was removed from the scene and taken to the morgue for autopsy. Coroner John Stanley hopes to make a positive identification on the body. When that happens he will issue a written news release. Autopsy results are not likely to be forthcoming in the near future. Evidence found at the scene is being taken to the Wisconsin Crime Laboratory in Madison for examination. Beyond the recovery scene, teams of detectives were responding to new leads. Many new tips came in following the discovery of the body yesterday. The Nolan family is in seclusion and asking media to respect their privacy at this time. At approximately 8:45 a.m. on July 9 a search team, utilizing a K9, discovered a body in a wooded area, on private property, near Schneider Road. The property is situated in the Town of Dunn. Detectives determined, based on what they could observe of the body, that this is a homicide investigation. Shortly after the discovery, a command post was established along Schneider Road. A multi-jurisdictional forensic team will be brought in to process the scene. This could be a couple of day process, and during that time the public should note that Schneider Road would be closed. Police will remain on the scene throughout this stage of the investigation. At a news conference Monday afternoon Dane County Coroner John Stanley indicated the victim is likely female, and evidence would suggest it maybe Kelly Nolan. However, Coroner Stanley emphasized that positive identification has not been made. The Nolan family is aware of these developments. Madison Police Chief Noble Wray has confirmed that cell phone technology led investigators to this area. It should be noted, that this is an area where aerial and other searches had been made earlier to no avail. Detectives determined an extensive search was necessary (See earlier portion of this release. The results of that massive search resulted in the discovery of this body.

Joel DeSpain Public Information Officer Madison Police Department _____________________________________________________________________________ On Monday, July 9, starting at sunrise, the Madison Police Department conducted a geographical search in an area immediately north of the Village of Oregon, east of Highway 14. The mission of the search operation was to locate articles or other evidence related to the disappearance of Kelly Nolan. During the course of investigation into Nolan's disappearance, information was developed identifying a number of geographical areas worthy of extensive searching. The Oregon search area was approximately three square miles. The Madison Police Department was assisted in today's search operations by special agents from the F.B.I., the Dane County Sheriff's Department, and several other police agencies from throughout Wisconsin and Illinois, including K9 and horse search teams. In addition several volunteers were enlisted to support today's operation including retired MPD police officers, the Salvation Army, Father Bill Connell from the Holy Mother of Consolation Catholic Church. The Madison Police Department and the Nolan family are thankful to all who assisted in today's operation. Two press briefings will be held at 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. (if needed) at the Holy Mother of Consolation Catholic Church, 651 N Main Street in Oregon.

Investigators believe Nolan could have been brought to that area around the time that she disappeared from downtown Madison - that would have been the early morning hours of June 23rd. Nolan went missing on the same weekend as the Village of Oregon\u2019s annual Summerfest celebration. There is no reason to believe Nolan attended that event, but we are using it as a benchmark for community members to test their recollection of that weekend. If anyone was in the Schneider Drive area that weekend of June 22, 23, 24, and saw anything that might aid in our investigation we ask that they call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Madison detectives continue to work this case full-time, and are appreciative of the help they are getting from the FBI, the Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation, the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department, and the Fitchburg Police Department. The MPD would particularly like to thank the hard working analysts at the State Crime Laboratory in Madison who have been very responsive and attentive to the department\u2019s needs in the Nolan investigation.",

Detectives remain very interested in having a conversation with Shari Broughton and continue to try to locate her. The person officers had hoped to find at the Doncaster Drive location was not found. Four people did come out of the home. They have been questioned, but were not arrested. The incident on Doncaster Drive had a peaceful resolution, which was a primary goal of the ERT.Update (12/06/07 @ 5:52p):  Officers are beginning to clear the scene.  Police are talking to a few citizens however, no one is currently under arrestOn December 6th, around 10:12 a.m., Madison Police responded to a home in the 4200 block of Doncaster Drive after receiving information that a person of interest in the Cypress Way homicide (see earlier incident report) might be found inside. The contact with the residence evolved into a standoff situation. A couple of people who were in the residence did come out and detectives are questioning those individuals. It is believed one, or more, may still be inside the residence. The Emergency Response Team is on scene. ERT members are proceeding carefully and methodically as to not put citizens, officers, or those who maybe inside the home at additional risk. It is believed there is no immediate danger to the neighborhood as this tactical event is targeted at one specific residence.Madison Police are also trying to locate two additional individuals who are also described as persons of interest in the Cypress homicide. Neither is the person who was being sought on Doncaster Drive (that name is not being released at this time). The \u201cadditional individuals\u201d are: Shari L. Broughton (4-4-72) and Napoleon Elvord (8-12-54) Broughton is 5\u20199\u201d and 130 lbs. Elvord is 6\u20190\u201d and 230 lbs. Photos of Broughton and Elvord are attached to this release.",

                        "Details": "BRITTANY ZIMMERMANN SCHOLARSHIP FUND (posted Wed. April 16th)-In the wake of her tragic death, the family of Brittany Zimmermann has announced that they are establishing a scholarship in Brittany's name and conducting a fund drive called \"Dollars for Brittany\".  A Marshfield credit union is facilitating the collection of funds.  Contributions can be sent to:Brittany Zimmermann Memorial FundC/O Marshfield Medical Center CUPO Box 279Marshfield, WI 54449(UPDATED Monday, April 14, 2008)The Madison Police Department is seeking additional information from people who were in the Bassett Neighborhood either on the day Brittany was killed, or on the day before her death. Specifically, detectives would like to speak with anyone who was solicited for money \u2013 or gave money to strangers - on either April 1st or April 2nd.  This would include citizens who were approached on the street, or at their homes, by one or more individuals. Investigators are focusing this effort on solicitations that were made on West Washington Ave., West Main St., West Wilson St., South Bedford St., South Bassett St., or West Doty Street.  The MPD would ask those with information to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.(UPDATED FRIDAY APRIL 11, 2008)Posters seeking information in the Brittany Sue Zimmermann case will soon be posted by Madison Police Officers in the Bassett Neighborhood, and in other areas of the central city. A copy of the poster has been attached to this incident report. Madison Crime Stoppers has now received approximately 200 tips in the Zimmermann case. In addition, some 25 new tips have come in reference the Joel Marino homicide. Joel was murdered on January 28th, and prior to Brittany\u2019s homicide around 70 tips had been received in the Marino investigation.There are some similarities in the cases. Both residents were killed inside their homes, during daylight hours, and no motive has been established in either case. There appears to be nothing in either victim\u2019s background that would make them targets of violence. Still, investigators do not know if the cases are connected, and there are differences. For example, in the Zimmermann case there were signs of forced entry. There was no evidence of forced entry in the Marino case. Both Marino and Zimmermann lived in close proximity, perhaps a mile or so apart. Because of the closeness detectives working the Marino case are coming across information that may help the Zimmermann case. Conversely, detectives working the Zimmermann case are coming across information that may aid the Marino probe.Both cases remain very active investigations.(UPDATED MONDAY APRIL 7)Some members of the media have been inquiring about a man who was going to various locations in the downtown (including a residence on West Washington Avenue) soliciting money from residents on the day of Brittany's death. This person is in custody on a probation hold, and is one of many who have been arrested (for things like probation holds and unrelated crimes) during the Zimmermann investigation. No suspect has been identified in the murder of Brittany. Detectives are continuing to pursue a plethora of leads. The MPD appreciates all of those who have come forward with information, and encourages others to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 as this remains a very active investigation. (UPDATED PRESS INFORMATION: RELEASED FRIDAY APRIL 4, 2008)The Madison Police Department, with assistance from the WI State Crime Laboratory, continued Friday to process the home of Brittany Sue Zimmermann. Forensic analysts at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison are already expediting the examination of some items found that may have evidentiary value.Meanwhile, the focus of the investigation continues on several fronts. Patrol officers and detectives have been talking with numerous people in the neighborhood including residents, commuters, business owners, and transients.   Police are seeking to speak with those who are willing to share information, and those who may be somewhat reluctant to contact police directly.   Police seek any information regarding activity in the area.   In the Zimmermann case, the MPD would like citizens to focus on the daytime \u2013 going into the nighttime hours -- of Wednesday April 2nd.   If anyone saw anything odd, strange, or out of the ordinary in the area of the crime scene\u2014a call to Crime Stoppers (608-266-6014) would be appreciated.In the last 24 hours more than 75 tips have come in to Crime Stoppers. Many of those calls are from people who have had strangers come to their doors, or into their homes recently, or over the course of the past several months. Several callers said at the time they did not call police. The MPD would urge anyone, at anytime, encountering a similar situation to call. Other tips in the Zimmermann investigation have come from downtown residents who saw people going door to door asking for money on the day of the homicide. In at least one case a man entered a residence. Investigators have identified many of these people, and have talked with them. It is not unusual during such contacts that arrests are made for unrelated matters. For instance, some contacts are made with those who may have outstanding warrants, or are wanted on probation holds.At this hour the MPD does not have a suspect, or suspects identified in the Zimmermann homicide.  The Dane County Coroner has determined Brittany died from a \u201ccomplexity of traumatic injuries.\u201d  Investigators have not established a motive. Madison and UW police officers will continue increased foot patrols in the Bassett Street Neighborhood.(UPDATED THURSDAY APRIL 3 @ 12:20 p.m.)Investigators in the Brittany Zimmermann homicide have concluded that her boyfriend is not a suspect in this case. He has been -- and continues to be -- very helpful in providing information to the detective team.Many leads have come in, and detectives are pursuing them. No suspect has been identified.The search of Brittany's home -- and the area around it -- continues.  Items of possible evidentiary value are being taken to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison for analysis.A member of the Dane County's Victim/Witness unit is working with Brittany's family. She will be keeping them posted on developments in the case, and has informed the MPD that the family is asking for privacy as they continue to grieve.A good number of tips have come in to the MPD, and citizens with any information that may help lead to an arrest are encouraged to continue to call the Madison Police Crime Stoppers line at 608-266-6014.--------------------------------------------(ORIGINAL RELEASE)Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday Madison Police were called to a residence in the 500 block of West Doty Street to check on a person. Ms. Zimmermann was found dead inside her home. Dane County Coroner John Stanley says a preliminary examination indicates the manner of death was homicide. The Madison Police Department is working in unison with the UW-Madison Police Department on this case, and a Command Post has been established inside the Central District station.Both Madison Police Chief Noble Wray, and UW Police Chief Susan Riseling have pledged extra patrols, and a heightened presence on Doty Street and surrounding areas for the time being.At this writing no suspects have been identified, and detectives have been unable to rule out that this may have been a random act.District Alderman Mike Verveer is looking to hold a community meeting this weekend to address concerns of residents.Meanwhile, a team of detectives will work the case around the clock, with patrol officers aiding in their efforts.Coroner Stanley has indicated a forensic examination will be done tomorrow morning at which time he may (or may not -- depending on consultation with investigators) release more information on the cause of death.\"This terrible crime is a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victim's family and friends,\" said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. \"I am going to work closely with the Madison Police Department and other law enforcement authorities to provide the resources necessary to bring the perpetrator to justice and address the public safety needs of the community",

                        "Details": "The letter below was written by Amanda Miller, fiancee of Joel Marino who was tragically murdered on January 28th.  This letter was provided to the Madison Police Department who was asked to share it with the community.Joel Marino was the love of my life. We had been happily dating and planning our lives together until he was taken from me on January 28, 2008. Joel was a compassionate, attentive, and sincere person who possessed a contagious enthusiasm for life. Joel was my first introduction to the city of Madison. I was a nursing student living in Dubuque, Iowa, when we began dating. Each time I made a trip to Madison, Joel became my personal tour guide. He loved that Madison was a city in which so many cultures, artists, musicians and academics were embraced.  After graduation, I was easily persuaded to move to Madison and I have been proud to call this city my home ever since.It is through our conversations about work that I know Joel had a great deal of respect and admiration for the medical community within Madison.  Joel was an EMT in college, and then later continued his passion for the medical profession, as he worked with patients needing pacemakers and ICDs.  Joel had the opportunity to work with physicians in all of the hospitals in Madison.  I know that Joel recognized the importance of each facility and how it helped to serve the community.As an E.R. nurse working in Madison, I am intimately aware of the procedures and protocols that exist to save lives in an emergency.  I would like to thank those that cared for Joel during his last hours.  I can't say enough about the brave citizens who called 911. The 911 dispatcher was professional and efficient in guiding those that called to assist Joel.  I want to thank the EMS team and first responders that transported Joel and began working to save his life.  Working as an E.R. nurse in Madison, I am confident that Joel was taken to the only facility that would have been able to effectively care for him due to the trauma his body had suffered.  The UW Hospital Trauma Center did everything they could for Joel and he was treated by an outstanding medical team.  There should be no doubt that Joel was given the best possible care and that each decision made in the process to save his life was done appropriately.I believe that through the tragic loss of Joel, Brittany Zimmerman and Kelly Nolan our community needs to work together to find answers.  I believe that by placing blame we distract from finding the answers we need to bring justice for Joel, Brittany and Kelly. I'm hoping that for the sake of those that loved Joel, the media will not play or sensationalize the 911 call made by the brave citizens who found him. Out of respect for those lost and their families, I hope that as a community, we can move beyond incidental details that do nothing to progress the ongoing investigations.  I'm asking my fellow citizens to assist by simply being conscientious and to watch out for the safety of their neighbors, friends and family. I'm confident that as a community we can find answers that will help us put these murders to rest and regain the sense of security we lost.I never thought I would have to imagine a life in Madison without Joel. But, I am committed to this community, as Joel was in his lifetime. Joel was an amazing man who left behind a powerful example for all of us on how to live our lives. This tragedy not only affects those that knew and loved Joel, but resonates with an entire community.

Sherman Avenue and was tragically struck by a SUV that fled the scene.  Police arrived on scene and through pointed investigative work on the part of officers, detectives, and investigators; a suspect was developed in the case.  Tammie L. Blizzard would later be arrested on charges listed above.  David C. Schmidt gallantly fought for his life for 37 agonizing days, but was sadly laid to rest on September 18th, 2007.  This particular case has impacted many individuals in a profound way, but the family has endured the most.  When friends and family speak of Schmidt, it is emphatically clear that he represented the utmost of a quality individual.On Sunday July 22nd, 2008 at (3:00PM) at The Madison Mallards Baseball Park (Warner Park), two of David C. Schmidt\u2019s grandsons will throw out the ceremonial pitch in honor and memory of their loved one.  These types of events mean a lot as the family continues to deal with a rather difficult situation.  The Madison Police Department continues to stress the importance that drinking alcohol and operating a motor vehicle should never coincide with one another.  This horrific incident could have been prevented with a small degree of responsibility on the part of the driver of the SUV to simply not drive if alcohol was on board.  A sentencing hearing was tentatively scheduled today at 3:00PM at the Dane County Courthouse (8th Floor) in the matter of State of Wisconsin vs. Tammie L. Blizzard.",

Eventually, when the store did not have the specific alcohol he was looking for, he took a bottle off the shelf and swung it at the victim, striking her in the head.  The clerk was able to avoid a major injury by somewhat moving out of the way.  The suspect fled to his vehicle with several bottles of alcohol from the store.  The victim followed the suspect out of the store, and noticing that the suspect dropped two bottles of alcohol, picked them up and threw them at the suspect's vehicle.  The suspect then punched the victim in the stomach.  If anyone has any information about this crime, they are encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.

The officer learned that an individual was walking in the 100 block of S. Butler when five black males approached him from behind a parked trailer.  The males immediately punched him in the face, knocked him to the ground, demanded money and stole his wallet before fleeing on foot.  A search of the area did not lead to any arrests.  The delay in releasing this information is due to the police department's response.  Several additional officers saturated the downtown area over the weekend and as Monday morning, no more strong-armed robberies were reported over that span.  This remains an on-going investigation.",

The manager of a vicinity store was preparing the store for business on this date, and after going inside of the establishment remembered she needed to retrieve additional items from her vehicle.  After responding back out to her vehicle and gathering those items she needed, she returned to the business and found herself attempting to unlock the security door to enter.  As she was in the midst of opening the door, the suspect listed above approached her from behind and pushed her body while simultaneously grasping a moneybag that she was holding.  The suspect would then run in the direction of Home Depot (North east direction).  The moneybag would contain an undisclosed amount of cash, and the victim sustained no injuries.  There was no mention of a weapon in this scenario, but the suspect in this matter is still at large.  As in all cases of this nature, we ask that citizens be extremely diligent in making keen assessments of their enviroment.  That information becomes increasingly important for individual safety and investigative measures to bring about arrests in crimes of this nature.  Persons with information regarding this matter are encouraged to contact the Madison Police Department or Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014. Callers can remain anonymous and may be elgible for a reward.PO Howard Payne",

The driver was able to back up toward his car, stalling to pretend to give money from his pockets and threw the pizzas at the suspects.

She indicated it was cut when someone grabbed her purse and took off running. The victim said she was just getting out of her car, which she had parked in front of the center, and was on her way to her weekly game of afternoon cards, when someone grabbed her purse. She says her car door was open, but she had not yet gotten her feet on the ground, when the snatch was made. Her finger was cut by the purse strap. She indicated she pulled on the strap in a futile attempt to maintain possession of her belongings. She then began yelling, \"help, help!\" She told police, \"her whole life was in that purse,\" including old photographs of her children and her address book. Staff from the neighborhood center went out to pursue suspects, but police were not able to make any arrests for the strong-armed robbery.  It is not known whether this crime is connected to other strong-armed robberies that took place last week.",

She says another white male was outside of the vehicle, and a black male was seated in the rear seat. She says she declined the offer. Next, she says the man who made the initial contact struck her in the head and tried to rob her. She says he and his accomplices drove off as two cars approached. An officer asked why she waited until the 16th to report the crime and she stated she was afraid and not sure what to do.",

Once officers arrived, they found the patio door slightly open, the apartment was cleared and the suspect was no longer there.  The victim stated that she had fallen asleep on the couch with all the lights on and that she had left the patio door unlocked.  The victim advised that she woke up and noticed an unknown man kneeling next to her holding a knife in his left hand, although not in a threatening manner. The victim pretended that she was still asleep by closing her eyes, but she then felt the suspect's hand touching one of her breasts over her clothing. The victim then jumped off the couch and started running toward one of the bedrooms screaming and yelling that there was someone in the house. There were other roommates in the house but everybody else was sleeping at the time of the incident. The suspect apparently exited the residence at this point. A search of the area was not successful in locating the suspect. However, a security guard recovered a backpack belonging to a friend of one of the victim's roommates and also a laptop computer belonging to another of the victim's roommates, not too far from the apartment.",

Initially officers took reports in which the suspect(s) entered through an unlocked door or window to steal laptops and ipods.  Within the last few weeks, reports have come in where force, breaking a window, etc. was used to gain entry into an apartment or house in the downtown area.  From 10/31-11/10 officers took 11 separate burglary reports in which mostly electronics were stolen, ranging from DVD's to CD's to laptops and ipods.  The majority of these burglaries occurred west of the Capitol, in the downtown area within student housing.  Additionally, over 25 laptops have been stolen since September and that does not include reports that have not been entered yet into the records system.  The Madison Police Department is actively investigating this problem and recognizes this is a nation-wide issue.  The Madison Police Department reminds the community that laptops, ipods and other electronic items are easy targets for thieves.  To protect your possessions please keep the following in mind:a) don't keep unattended valuables in plain viewb) record your driver's license/State on your valuables, not your Social Security numberc) lock all doors and windowsd) back up all important documents on disks stored separatelye) report suspicious activity (some burglars have been caught in the house saying they were contractors or workers \"and must have got the address wrong\")f) if storing valuables in your car, put them in the trunkg) have a sign-in system or video in your buildingh) obtain a lock and cable if you do need to leave your laptop unattended.",

On 11/30/06 an alert neighbor witnessed Haselton snooping around a house and called police.  Officers and detectives worked the house with the homeowner who returned and noticed things of value missing.  A suspect description and vehicle description was aired to other officers.  By chance an officer spotted a suspect vehicle and noticed the driver appeared to match the description.  A traffic stop was made and stolen goods were located in the vehicle.  Detectives are working this case with the hope of solving most of the residential burglaries that have occurred in this area of the city.

One roommate was asleep while the home he lived in was being burglarized.  A second roommate came home from classes to see two individuals (Sturkey) inside their home stealing a laptop and video game equipment.  The roommate who came home from class screamed and gave chase to the fleeing suspects while the second roommate called 9-1-1.  Both suspects fled and a foot chase ensued.  One roommate caught Sturkey and detained him until police arrived. The other suspect fled.  While this was occurring, officers responded to at least two other locations in the Central District for burglary complaints.  In one instance a resident interrupted the burglary and the suspect asked \"is this (blank)'s home\" and when learning \"it wasn't\" quickly fled.  Those reports are not available at this time.  Entry into these homes has been through unlocked doors or windows.  Again, as good practice and in the interest of sound public safety, it is strongly recommended to lock your doors and window to help prevent crime.  There have been numerous reports of laptop and electronic equipment stolen in the student housing areas of the Mifflin/Dayton corridor.",

Madison Police warned this part of the city of the rash of break-ins and to be observant and notify police of suspicious behavior.  This warning paid off.  On Sunday 6/10 a suspect was arrested and that male was taken into juvenile custody.  After being released, the suspect began to commit more burglaries via the same method.  On Monday an alert resident noticed this male suspect in the neighborhood, ringing doorbells.  As the suspect walked around the house, the observant neighbor called police.  The suspect was caught inside the house, befriending a pitbull.  The juvenile is now in an unsecured location under court order not to leave.  At this point, the Madison Police Department is investigating how many burglaries this individual may be responsible for.",

He yelled at him to stop, but the suspect kept on trying to remove the screen. After accomplishing that task, the suspect then started to try to remove a window fan. Frightened, the victim fled his apartment and called police. Officers tracked the suspect down a couple of blocks up State Street toward the State Capitol. A backpack containing his identification was found outside the victim's window. The arresting officer reported the suspect's breath smelled of intoxicants, and his speech was slurred.

The officer heard citizens shouting about a suspect who was on the run with a stolen laptop computer. The officer saw there was a foot chase nearby and drove - red lights and siren - in the direction of the pursuit. Next the officer observed the stolen laptop was now in the hands of the guy who was just chasing the suspect. A witnessed flagged the officer down and said the suspect was now running toward Lake Mendota at the far end of the park. The officer drove and spotted the culprit. This became a foot chase, which ended when the suspect arrived at a six-foot chain link fence. He was attempting to climb it when the officer grabbed his jacket and pants and pulled him down. The suspect and officer struggled, and the suspect broke free after elbowing the officer in the chest. Another citizen - a former wrestler with 13 years of grappling experience - next tackled the suspect. This citizen later told officers he knew if he put an elbow near the side of the suspect's face that the suspect would be pinned and unable to move. A backup officer arrived on the scene and the citizen stepped back. The suspect continued to struggle until being hit with an Electronic Control Device Taser. He had more than 500 cash in his socks. Officers also recovered a pair of brown gloves. The original victim told police he was in his apartment, with opera music playing on his laptop computer, when he heard some rustling at the window. It is near a table, and on top of that table, was the laptop. The victim stood up and saw the suspect reach through a freshly cut window screen and grab his computer. The victim said others joined him as he chased the suspect down. He got his laptop back, and this was just about the time the officer started pursuing the suspect.",

The victim assessed the situation and tried to help.  After the discussion on what may have been wrong ensued, the driver sped off with the victim holding on.  The victim did not let go, as he feared for his safety.  The passengers in the car were pleading with the driver to stop.  Eventually the victim let go when he was near some grass, in an attempt to let go safely.  Officers measured the drag to be approximately 15/100 of a mile, from part of Lien Rd to the 1600 block of Mendota Ave.  The victim did not seek medical attention.  This incident is being investigated by the Madison Police Department.  Anyone with additional information is encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.

The driver of the truck involved in the collision had been eastbound on Highway 30 when three pedestrians began running across the highway.  The driver could not avoid the collision.  The driver immediately stopped and attempted to render aid while his passenger jumped out of the truck and yelled at the other two pedestrians to stop and even tried to catch them as they fled.  They yelled back that they had to catch a bus and refused to stop, leaving their companion at the scene and continuing to flee.  The driver of the pick up truck was fully cooperative with the accident investigation and several other witnesses also stayed to assist.  The accident remains under investigation.  The driver of the truck and his passenger were uninjured and were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash. Alcohol was not a factor for the driver; toxicology results pending on the deceased.  The driver was released after giving a statement to the police. Investigators are still attempting to contact the other two pedestrians.",

He was later admitted for observation. The cause of the accident is still under investigation. However, it appears that the driver of the tow truck switched lanes without the proper clearance.",

Through the investigation officers learned that the two males described above had stolen a car and crashed it into a parked vehicle on Loreen Dr.  The two males, along with five other friends, were in West Towne Mall when they noticed a set of keys next to a candy machine.  One key was for a KIA vehicle, so the group took the key to several KIA's in the mall parking lot until they found a match.  In doing so, the seven individuals stole the KIA and drove around for two hours.  They dumped some personal belongings out in a dumpster, which officers recovered for the victim.  Eventually they were traveling on Loreen and noticed a girl they recognized.  In waving to the girl, the driver lost sight of the road and crashed into a parked, unoccupied vehicle (Toyota Tercel) and in doing so moved it over 10 feet.  Everyone inside the KIA fled on foot.  One person was injured because when the crash occurred he wasn't wearing a seatbelt and hit his head into the windshield.  Fire/Rescue responded and determined the injury to be minor and the juvenile was not transported to a hospital.",

Dispatchers conveyed to responding officers, based on numerous calls, that there was a car vs. moped collision.  Upon arrival, The Madison Fire Department and Madison Police found an unconscious 20 year old male (who had been operating the moped) with head/leg injuries after initially traveling south bound on N.Park.  After officers investigated this matter, it was determined that the moped operator made an indiscriminate left turn (east bound) and was impacted by an oncoming car traveling north bound on N.Park Street.  The 20-year-old moped operator did not yield to oncoming traffic, and after being initially impacted by the car, subsequently impacted the windshield of that vehicle.  The driver of the car did not sustain any injuries whatsoever.  The moped operator was cited/found at fault for this accident upon the completion of the investigation. The Madison Police Department continues to alert all roadway operators to pay particular attention at busy intersections, and to use extra precautions when making decisions of crossing the pathway of oncoming vehicles.  Based on information we have at this time, no life threatening injures resulted in this matter, but taking additional steps to evaluate every action is always the safest way to proceed.PO Howard Payne",

Officers arrived on scene and found 5 individuals that were all occupants of 2 vehicles that required immediate medical attention.  Investigators at the scene, taking into account witness statements and physical evidence, determined that a 2002 Chevy Impala was traveling east bound on Hammersley Road and impacted a 1998 BMW traveling south bound on S. Whitney Way.  As a result of the accident, the two occupants of the BMW {Brian P McNally 26-year-old male of Waunakee Wisconsin who sustained multiple internal injuries that are deemed as potentially life threatening & and Megan T. McNally 20-year-old female of Nashotah Wisconsin who sustained minor injuries} were both treated as a local hospital.  Brian McNally is still listed in critical condition.The Chevy Impala containing 3 passengers; Dedonta J Davis, 18-year-old male of Madison, WI who was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital & Rikita L. Lee, 21- year-old female of Madison who was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at UW Hospital on 12/25/06 per the Office of the Dane County Coroner.  The driver of this vehicle Ian M. Bowers, 19-year-old male of Madison has been tentatively charged with Homicide By Intoxicated Use Of A Vehicle (Wis State Statue 940.09(1)(1) \u2013 Felony), but since this is an ongoing investigation additional charges could be imminent.  The Madison Police Department in conjunction with the Dane County District Attorney Office will continue to collaborate in determining what charges are most appropriate in this scenario. The Madison Police department would point to this tragic reminder that a combination of alcohol, excessive speed, and the lack of utilizing seat restraints contributed to the accident occurring and injuries having been sustained.  It goes without saying that with the New Year holiday quickly approaching, we would hope that all citizens of this city and abroad pay special attention to these all to important factors that resulted in a tragic event.   We would hope that everyone would make all concerted efforts to use sound judgment when operating a motor vehicle at all times.  People sometimes forget that all roadways can only remain safe if we personally take responsibility and follow simple rules relating to the safe operation of a motor vehicle.   **  The McNally family has no public comment to make at this time. We request that the press and other interested parties respect our privacy at this difficult time!  **PO Howard Payne",

The victim (who had just watched the Mallard\u2019s season finale) was walking in a cross walk, and was in a well-lit intersection, when he was struck. It should be noted that the suspect was not at the Mallard's game, and that additional charges are probable.------------------------------------------------------Male subject walking with group from Mallard's Game crossing N.

Gurbanov attempted to move away from the vehicle, and apparently lost control on the shoulder, causing his Vehicle (Volvo) to roll approximately 3 times across the median and come to a rest upside down within the WB lanes of Hwy 12. Gurbanov was wearing a seatbelt and was able to extricate himself from the vehicle. Due to Gurbanov operating on a Suspended License, he was issued a citation. Gurbanov was later conveyed to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries.",

Later at approx. 6:14 p.m. a large Dodge truck struck a Nissan Maxima, causing the Maxima to collide into a 1982 VW vehicle, causing the VW to collide into a Jeep Cherokee, causing the Cherokee to collide into the truck that was assisting the stalled vehicle. There were 5 total vehicles damaged. One driver was transported for minor injuries. The 1982 VW vehicle apparently has been converted into a vehicle that runs on vegetable oil and the collision caused over 20 gallons of oil to spread over the street causing a hazard. The road is shut down until further notice to get sand on the oil.",

They discovered two vehicles had gone off the highway, past a fence line, and were now in a field near Odana Road. A Monroe man was inside a 1999 Ford truck, which was now on its side. He had been wearing a seatbelt and suffered only minor injuries. He told police he had just gotten off work at a local grocery store and was on his way home when he spotted in his rearview mirror a vehicle rapidly coming up behind him. Since it was traveling fast in the left lane he assumed it would just pass him as he was in the right lane. However; the vehicle, a 2001 Chevy Suburban, instead turned sharply his way careening into the rear end of his truck. The driver of the Suburban was ejected from the Chevy during the crash. He was taken to a local hospital with multiple injuries and was listed in critical condition. Madison police investigators are also looking to see if the Suburban was involved in a hit-and-run collision that took place in a parking lot on Park Street a short time before the beltline crash. The hit-and-run involved someone backing a Suburban into a parked vehicle. Additional charges in this case are possible.",

Officers would arrive on scene and find a male (Craig S. Sawicki - 26yr old M/W of Beloit WI) who was ejected from & pinned beneath a vehicle that allegedly rolled several times before coming to its final resting place in a field near the intersection.  Sawicki was a passenger in a 2007 Nissan Altima.  Allegedly this vehicle was being driven by a female (Nicole L. Endres - 28yr old F/W of Madison WI).An associate of Sawicki/Endres (Jan E Pilon \u201332 yr old F/W of Madison) would pull up to the accident scene shortly after it occurred. Preliminary reports reflect both Endres and Pilon being contacted at Pilon\u2019s residence a short time after authorities would deal with this unfortunate fatality accident.Endres is being tentatively charged with Homicide By Negligent Use of a Vehicle and Pilon is tentatively charged with Party To A Crime for allegedly transporting Endres from the scene of the accident.  The Dane County Coroner's Office made a timely notification of the deceased (Craig S. Sawicki), and The Madison Police Department Accident Investigators are continuing to gather details.  Both speed and alcohol are thought to have been contributing factors in this accident.PO Howard Payne",

From preliminary reports, a metal piece of furniture had possibly fallen off of a vehicle and occupied one of the EB lanes.  A SUV, thought to be a Trailblazer, attempted to avoid striking the metal object by swerving left.  This resulted in the Trailblazer striking a Town & Country Van.  The impact of the two vehicles would send the van crashing into the guardrail, and the Trailblazer would end up in a flipped position.  Madison Fire Department quickly arrived on scene to deal with medical issues of all parties.  No one suffered any significant injuries in this accident, but this accident could have been much more serious.  The roadway did have to be closed to allow emergency vehicles and tow trucks access to the scene to deal with this situation.  Vehicles were extracted promptly and the roadway was opened up shortly after 12:30pm.The Madison Police Department reminds all drivers carrying items inside of vehicles to make sure all items are securely fastened, and that there is no possibility of any cargo falling from your vehicle.  It is the responsibility of all to keep roadways as safe as possible, and taking precautions such as securing your cargo is just one step in decreasing the number of accidents that occur on an annual basis.",

The Madison Fire Department immediately attended to the medical needs of a 19-year-old female after she was struck crossing N. Lake Street at University Avenue.  Officers that responded to the scene determined that a 1999 Audi was traveling north bound on N. Lake Street, and when this vehicle approached University Avenue the 19-year-old victim happened to be in the crosswalk and was struck.  Officers on scene conducted interviews of witnesses that all verified one contention that the pedestrian was illegally crossing the street and the vehicle had no negligence in this matter.  The victim was conveyed to a local hospital, and preliminary information stated that the injuries sustained were non-life threatening.  Citations were issued to the pedestrian for both an alcohol violation and failure to yield to vehicle.Upon review of video surveillance cameras at this intersection several hours after this incident occurred, additional charges may be pending as this investigation continues.  The Madison Police Department feels that this is yet another example where video surveillance cameras aid both the public from a safety standpoint, and bolsters our ability to uncover crucial details that helps determine what actually occurred at scenes such as this.PO Howard Payne",

As the AED was attached to the victim, Officer Dexheimer was successful in getting the victim breathing again.  The victim also regained a pulse.  Fire Rescue transported the victim to St. Mary's Hospital for further assessment and treatment where staff indicated the patient was stable and doing well.",

Immediate compliance of officer commands saved what could have been a tragic incident, as the fake guns that were used appeared real.  After investigating what transpired it was learned that the individuals were making a movie for a college class with pellet guns.  The \"actors\" involved all received disorderly conduct citations.  This incident is the second time in two weeks where Madison Police responded to gun situations in which it turned out to be film production with artificial guns.  In fluid circumstances a fake gun can appear very real and could lead to tragic circumstances.  The Madison Police Department encourages those using fake guns during film productions to alert us to the fact ahead of time and follow proper procedures prior to filming.",

After other officers arrived, the primary officer conducted a search to where Ly went.  The officer noticed some ruffled plants and then observed a loaded 9mm handgun that was fresh on scene.  Through the course of the investigation, it was learned that Ly possessed the weapon and was in possession on school grounds.  Ly was arrested and booked into the Dane County Jail.",

It was reported to Police that a disturbance involving up to 50 people occurred in the common area of West Town Mall on January 18th, 2006.  A very similar scenario occurred on January 19th, 2006 where 20-30 juveniles were allegedly fighting at the Madison Metro West Transfer Point; some allegedly with baseball bats. Based on intelligence information developed by Madison Police, a plan was devised to use additional resources in the effort of alleviating any potential problems that might arise at the school.  Five juveniles were arrested on charges ranging from disorderly conduct to possession of a dangerous weapon on school grounds, which are misdemeanor offenses!  Two facsimile firearms, edged weapons, and pepper spray were recovered in the arrests.

In contacting the victim vehicle, it was learned that they were inbound on Milwaukee Street, near Fair Oaks Ave, when they came across a vehicle stopped in traffic and the occupants were talking to a pedestrian.  The victim vehicle had to go in another lane of traffic to avoid this hazard and honked its horn at the stopped vehicle.  Shortly after passing the vehicle, the victim\u2019s rear window shattered and another window was \"spider-webbed\", causing the victims to believe they were shot.  The victim vehicle fled to E. Washington and the offending vehicle continued to follow as the victims contacted the 911 Center.  Eventually after turning on a few other streets, the victims and offending vehicles separated.  A description of the offending vehicle was aired over police radio.  An astute officer heard the aired description and noticed the vehicle traveling in-bound on E. Washington Avenue and initiated a traffic stop.  There were five persons in the vehicle.  Subsequent to an investigation, officers recovered a \"BB pump air rifle\" and an \"air powered bb handgun\" inside the vehicle.  Additionally, officers were able to identify the parties involved who shot out the windows.  Hill and Buchanan were transported to the Dane County Jail, while the 16 year-old was transported to the Juvenile Reception Center.",

                        "Details": "On 2/21/06 at approximately 4:11 p.m. Madison Police Officers were dispatched to Memorial H.S. for an incident involving an \u201cairsoft\u201d pellet gun.  Dispatched advised that several people were running from the school grounds to the Tree Lane area.  Officers learned where the suspects were due to a school principal following them after the incident. Officers made contact with the suspect, Graffee, several other juveniles and the victim who remained near school.  It was learned that Graffee, who wanted to fight outside school near the bus stop, confronted the victim.  After a brief struggle, Graffee and the victim parted ways and the victim went back into school.  Approximately 3-4 minutes went by and as the victim started to leave the school, Graffee confronted her.  This time Graffee took out a pellet gun and shot the victim with approximately 20 pellets in the chest, stomach, and head and neck area. Graffee appeared to run out of pellets, so a 12 year-old boy, who was with Graffee, took out a pellet gun and shot the victim approximately four times. The victim stated it \"hurt a little bit\".  The victim stated she believed the guns were not real from the beginning as they looked like plastic.  In arresting Graffee, officers recovered a container of \"softair\" 6 mm pellets and collected the spent pellets near the scene.  She was transported to the Dane County Jail without incident.  The 12 year-old boy was turned over to his mother.",

Though there were dozens of small children in the area, both sides recklessly fired several rounds in this otherwise peaceful neighborhood. One shot fired from 5821 ended up lodged in the wall of an apartment a block and a half away after narrowly missing the resident of that apartment.Many area residents called police and provided information to the investigating officers.

Since there was reliable information given to dispatchers advising officers that it was highly probable that weapons were in one or both of the vehicles, a high risk felony stop was conducted on the 1984 Pontiac stopped in the 4800 blk of Lovell Lane.After all subjects were ordered out of the vehicle at gunpoint, a subsequent search of the vehicle by officers uncovered a fully loaded .38 caliber revolver.  It should also be noted that one of Madison's Canine Handlers responded, and through use of that resource more than 15 individually packaged baggies of Cocaine Base (weighing 2.9grams) were confiscated.  Based on reliable information, a solid tactical response by police, and police canine involvement, this turned out to be a case where further violence was foiled in its infancy.

Following this shouting match the suspect pulled what appeared to be a weapon and started shooting at the males.  The suspect then left the area in that vehicle heading eastbound on Regent St.  The vehicle was later stopped and five occupants were detained.  A weapon was recovered from the vehicle and identified as a pellet gun replicating an automatic handgun.  After a thorough investigation the shooter was identified and arrested.  Another of the occupants of the vehicle was also arrested for a probation hold.  It is believed that no one was injured, that the school was not the target nor was the student population at risk.

After officers arrived on scene, they would interview a number of witnesses that reside in the area that reported multiple shots being fired near Churchhill Drive & Greenway View Drive.  Area residents reported broken glass and the smell of gasoline, and officers would later find evidence of such along with multiple 9mm bullet casings near the 2900 block of Todd Drive.  One vehicle of interest was described as 1980\u2019s Crown Victoria or Chevrolet boxy styled car that was seen in the area during the time area residents reported hearing the shots.  There may have also been a van in the area at the time.   Broken glass at the scene may be suggestive of damage to windows of the involved vehicle(s).  It is also thought that the odor of gasoline could be a result of damage to a vehicle as well.Madison police officers worked through inclement weather to preserve evidence at the scene after this matter was reported, but we are asking that anyone with information about this incident contact the The Madison Police Department as soon as possible.  No known victims or suspects have been developed in this case, and any information would prove to aid in our investigation.PO Howard Payne",

The incident occurred in the 900 block of Engelhart Dr on the sidewalk next to Indian Springs Park. The victim, a 23 year-old female, who was walking with six family members and four dogs, had a wound below her lower lip. From the size of the wound and the statements of witnesses, it was thought that she was probably shot with a pellet gun. Fire Department Paramedics treated the victim at the scene.Witnesses reported seeing a white mini-van pass the group once and they heard popping noises. When the van passed them again, witnesses again heard popping and the victim was struck in the face. The van was described as an older model mini-van, possibly a 93 or 94 model, with a protruding engine compartment. There were two Hispanic males in the in the divers and front passenger seats.This is believed to be a random attack. Neighbors report seeing the van in the area on previous occasions and report incidents of pellet damage to garage doors and windows dating back to the fall of 2006. Please call Madison Police if you have any information about suspects or are the victim of other attacks. Police are also interested in sightings of the vehicle or suspects in the Moorland Rd \u2013 Indian Springs area.",

One of the boys had a handgun, and was holding it in front of him with both hands on the weapon. Based on training, the officer recognized the boy\u2019s stance as being one of a possible threat. The officer called for back up, and approached the residence in a tactical manner, using a tree for cover. The boys ran inside the residence, and later admitted they had been playing with an air gun. It looked just like a real weapon. The replica gun and ammo were taken as evidence. Madison Police urge parents to realize officers must make split second decisions when dealing with weapons, and it's impossible to quickly determine which are real, and which are facsimiles",

A staff member at the Childhood Learning Center indicated approximately 80 students had been placed in lock-down status. The Learning Center employee said shots were at first heard, and then a suspect was spotted outside carrying a long-barreled handgun. Responding officers determined the suspect had likely exchanged fire with someone inside a passing car. One round appeared to have broken an upper glass window in the foyer area of an apartment building, but no one was injured. A Sgt. requested the assistance of Madison K-9 Ivan, a one-year-old German Shepard, so that apartment building could be checked for possible weapons. Ivan is able to search for fresh human scent, and it was thought a weapon that had just been fired would have such a scent. Ivan did not detect anything on the upper floors, but upon entering the basement he showed great interest in an area of a storage locker where an air conditioner had been placed. Ivan's partner then found a long-barreled handgun next to the air conditioner. Outside of the building Ivan put his nose to work and found a bullet casing.",

A couple (man & woman) had been asleep when two men kicked in the door to their apartment. One of the invaders was armed with a handgun. The thugs threatened the couple, and the female was punched in the face. They (the home invaders) were yelling something about money and drugs. They rummaged through areas of the apartment and left. The couple could not think of any reason why someone would try to rob them.Madison police detectives are looking to see if there is a connection between this case and similar home invasion on Sachtjen Street that occurred a short time earlier on the eighth.Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers 266-6014.  Callers can remain anonymous and maybe eligible for a cash reward.",

Officers arrived dressed in full military-style police uniform and observed a male matching the suspect description standing in the middle of the Food Court.  Officers attempted to contact the suspect (later identified as Lemon) and escort him from the crowded mall area.  The suspect had his hand in his pocket and began to physically resist, at that point officers took control of the suspect's other arm.  The suspect then made statements that he was going to punch an officer.  Based on the weapon information and the suspect's physical resistance, officers attempted to take the suspect to the ground.  Because of the wet, snow-covered tile, they were unable to take the suspect to the ground.  An additional officer responded, observed the physical struggle, and deployed their assigned electronic control device.  One of the probes struck the suspect and the other probe struck the suspect's wife.  Both the suspect and the suspect's wife were secured in handcuffs (the suspect's wife was later released with no charges or injuries).  The suspect made statements that he had a heart condition, therefore Madison Fire Department responded and later conveyed the suspect to St. Mary's emergency room, where he was evaluated, cited for resisting/obstructing, and released.",

That was when the mother saw a passenger pointing the gun, not at her car specifically, but just pointing it out of the window of the suspect car.  Madison & Town of Madison police responded and executed a felony stop on the 1990 Olds Delta 88. Two BB pistols, two black masks and a large machete-style knife with a 19\" blade were seized. The victim said seeing someone pointing a handgun -- one that looked to be very real -- out of a car window was \"quite disturbing.\" The occupants of the Delta 88 were arrested.",

One witness looked out of his home and saw a man standing in the street and next to a running car. He says the headlights were on and the man was firing rounds from a handgun.  A couple of concerned residents reported hearing two or three shots -- followed by a several second pause -- before a final burst of five to seven rounds. Officers recovered shell casings from a .45-caliber handgun from two locations. A police investigator found at least one slug in a tree, which officers concluded might have been the target of the shooter. One-witness reports seeing a white Honda Civic hatchback speeding westbound on Spaight towards Jenifer Street just after the gunfire.",

                        "Details": "At 7:00 p.m. Sunday night a citizen reported two subjects with guns inside a storefront in the 1700 block of Monroe St. It was also reported that another subject had his hands tied behind his back. At least thirteen officers from the Madison Police Department responded to the weapons incident involving a possible hostage. Several of the officers were members of the MPD Emergency Response Team (ERT). UW police also assisted. Upon arrival a perimeter was established and traffic on Monroe St was redirected. An officer positioned across the street from the store confirmed that a subject inside was carrying a shotgun.While officers were on scene, one subject emerged from the building and was taken into custody. In response to the commands issued to this first subject, three others left the store and were promptly detained. From these subjects it was learned that six other subjects were still in the building. It was also learned that all were members of group known as Strollers Theatre. They were rehearsing a play involving guns and a hostage. As one cast member remarked about the prop guns, \u201cThey\u2019re suppose to look real.\u201dWhile the outcome of this incident seems humorous, it is worth noting that the officers responded \u201clights and siren\u201d, real rifles and handguns were directed towards citizens and a peaceful neighborhood was disrupted and disturbed by the sight of armed subjects both real and imagined. The four subjects who emerged from the building were subjected to the brusque professionalism required of officers in these situations. They were ordered to back toward the voices of the armed officers, handcuffed, searched and at least one was placed in a squad.The director and crew were urged to cover the windows and inform the 911 Center when rehearsing scenes that might be misunderstood if observed out of context. It is not unusual for dramatic groups and filmmakers to use Madison as a backdrop for their productions. MPD asks such groups to consider public perceptions and work with us to assure that everyone is safe and that reality doesn\u2019t intrude. The building in this case is a vacant store that was being used by the theater group for rehearsals. All subjects were released without charges.",

These crimes have included drug dealing, illegal drinking, and the firing of guns. Members of the South District's Community Policing Team (CPT) were working proactively in the area of Penn Park late Wednesday afternoon when officers spotted two men consuming beer in the park's pavilion, which is prohibited. One of the men walked away from officers. He was later found to have several small bags of marijuana in his pant's pocket. A CPT officer retraced the suspect's steps and found a loaded handgun - a silver-colored Derringer 38 special \u2013 stashed near the park\u2019s shelter.",

Since the probable cause bulletin that had been disseminated clearly named Yancy, he was contacted and subsequently arrested.  Authorities would search Yancy and find a loaded .22 revolver and ammunition along with .7grams of Marijuana(THC).  Agents with both the US Marshals and ATF (Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms) were on scene as well.  When Yancy was asked about the gun he had in his possession, he stated he had found the firearm in a nearby area.  Yancy would be booked into the Dane County Jail on the two charges of Carrying a Concealed Weapon and Possession of THC.  Other charges related to why Yancy was contacted initially were dealt with by The Monona Police Department.PO Howard PayneMadison Police Department",

The gun's owner made a comment to the effect of, \"Oh s ____!\" He then retrieved the weapon, tucked it back in his waistband, paid for his cigarettes, and quickly left the store. Also present in the PDQ at the time of the gun drop were three Town of Madison Police Officers. They were not near the cash register, but over near the area where one would glean a cup of coffee, and as such did not see the gun drop. One witness said he knew the officers were there but did not want to alert them fearing he might end up in the middle of a gun battle.

The caller admitted his involvement explaining, \"It's fun to see all the police drive by with lights on, and I like it.\" A Madison Police Officer explained the dangers of providing false information to emergency responders, and how he tied up vital resources at a time when others were in real need of assistance. The suspect was taken to his home and released to a parent. A follow-up investigation is being done and the boy will likely be cited  (see potential charges listed above).",

Minutes earlier a concerned resident had seen the suspect and a half-dozen other young men walk past the caller's residence on Wagon Trail. Officers detained the teens at gunpoint near Orlando Bell Park, and discovered the weapon in questions was actually a pellet gun. The teen carrying it said he had pointed it at the feet of his friends while pulling the trigger, but never intended to hurt anyone. He said they were just playing. The 13 year-old went on to explain that another friend had removed the orange plastic piece from the gun's muzzle to make it look more like a real handgun.  All of the teens\u2019 parents were called to the scene to view the weapon, and officers counseled the young men about how dangerous it is to walk around in public with something that looks like a real gun.In her report on the incident, a Madison Police sergeant wrote: \"This was another adrenaline spiking near-miss situation where, with one suspect pointing the pistol at his friends, we were fortunate not have an officer-involved shooting.\"An attachment to this release shows a police officer's real Glock Model 19 next to the modified BB pistol.

As members of the group saw the marked squad one individual began walking away from the rest. The officer believes the others from the group were yelling at him not to run. The officer then got out of his car and approached the suspect. The officer noted that as he did this the suspect very softly uttered the words, \"oh s---\". It was determined the suspect was not a student at West, and was not supposed to be on school grounds. He was found to be carrying individually wrapped bags of suspected marijuana. He also had $275 in cash. The suspect told the officer his mother and grandmother gave the money to him for his birthday. The officer quickly noted that the suspect's birthday is July 4th and it is now October. While the officer questioned the suspect he noticed that the young man's cell phone continued to ring over and over again.",

A MPD officer knocked on the door. A resident opened it, but would not let the officer enter the apartment. He (the resident) insisted there was no need for alarm that he was simply burning some sage. Nevertheless, firefighters needed to determine for themselves the cause of the smoke. Police and fire personnel entered the apartment. An ashtray was found to have in it a substance that was still smoking and smoldering. Firefighters checked out the rest of the apartment for additional smoking sources and discovered marijuana grow operation \u2013 complete with custom ductwork -- in a bedroom. Members of the Dane County Narcotics and Gang Task Force were summoned. They seized 44 pot plants, and the resident was arrested.",

The driver (Cervantes-Reyes) & front seat passenger (Martinez-Arias) had no identification whatsoever, but based on suspicions the officer had related to drugs, a K-9 Officer was requested at the scene of the traffic stop for further investigation.A Madison Police Department K-9 handler would arrive, and a sniff of the exterior/interior of the vehicle would result in illegal contraband (Marijuana) being located in several areas of the car.  No individual within this vehicle would claim knowledge or responsibility for approximately 4.5 grams of Marijuana and other items of interest, but both Cervantes-Reyes and Martinez-Arias would be arrested for Possession With Intent To Deliver THC and Party To A Crime respectively.  There were 2 other juvenile passengers in the vehicle that would be returned to their residences by police.  This is yet another case of solid police work on the part of the officer conducting the initial surveillance and accessibility of K-9 related resources.

The officer locked a laser unit on the Caddy and clocked it at 60 miles-per-hour. The speed limit on this stretch of East Wash is 35. The officer then pulled the car over. While talking with the driver the officer had to keep warning him to stop moving around, and to keep his hands where the officer could see them. But, the driver kept reaching into the glove compartment, and into the middle console. At one point he had in his hand a bottle of cologne, which he sprayed around the inside of the vehicle. At this point the officer asked the man to step outside of the car. During this process the suspect broke away from the officer, and took off running. He did not get far as other officers were arriving at the scene. They took him into custody. A Dane County Deputy also showed up with a police dog. The K9 had great interest in the smell of something in the dash area near the car\u2019s steering wheel. Officers discovered the whole display of that area of the dash actually pulls out, and that behind it is a hiding place. It was there that more than 30 grams of marijuana was discovered. It was contained in many individually wrapped packages. The marijuana and other items - including the bottle of Hilfiger Athletic cologne - were taken into evidence.",

Earlier in the day, Dane County Sheriffs Deputies attempted to serve eviction paperwork to residents at 2426 Center Avenue but fled before deputies could contact them.  Area residents reported to police that there had been 2-3 unfamiliar persons walking in the back yards of homes in this area after deputies had left, and when confronted claimed to be searching for cell phones they had lost.  The suspicious persons were checking in bushes, shrubs, and alongside a residence with differing explanations of why they were in the area.In an attempt to provide the residents of this neighborhood with an additional measure of security, Madison Police used a dog to sniff the area and was subsequently lead to a large package of crack cocaine hidden in the bushes; believed to be dumped there by individuals that had fled from deputies earlier.  Area residents assisted police in this matter by providing specific information about suspicious behavior, and it inevitably led to a large amount of illegal drugs being located by MPD Canine/Handler.  Approximately 80.5 grams of Cocaine Base was recovered in this case, and a collaborative effort on the part of both citizens and police kept the illegal/dangerous substance out of the hands of unsuspecting children.  This was an outstanding effort on the part of all parties involved in this case and reflected another instance where citizens make a difference by being observant and aware of what is going on in their community.",

In doing so Gundy was able to receive store credit because he did not have a receipt.  It was learned that Gundy has done this in the past only to attempt to sell his store credit cards while still inside the building to unsuspecting customers, for a lesser cost.  Officials estimate thousands of dollars have been credited to Gundy.  In conducting a routine data check on Gundy it was also learned that he has an outstanding warrant in Iowa for retail theft.  Gundy was transported to the Dane County Jail without incident.",

The clerk then asked what the bulge was in his pants and it was a metallic type work glove.  Jadzewski then took off running and the clerk, along with others, chased him.  Jadzewski crossed Hwy 51 on foot and was struck by a van swerving out of the way.  Jadzewski fell to the ground, as he was hit the drive-side door, and then got back up continuing to run away.

Madison detectives are seeking charges of Sexual Assault of a Child and Attempted Child Enticement. Their paperwork will go to the District Attorney for a charging decision. The suspect has been in custody since the incident, and there has been no additional danger to the community. Madison Police urge parents to talk with their children about stranger danger. The Department is very thankful for the actions of members of the community in coming to the aid of this child. A couple walking near the Lapham playground was the first to be concerned about what they were seeing. They went into the school and contacted a Lapham school employee. She came out, questioned the man and girl, and called police.",

The physical description of the driver is similar in all incidents; however, three put him in a black SUV, while a fourth indicates the man was driving a white pickup truck. The first reported incident was on October 8th. A woman says she was walking her dog near Bradbury Court when the man pulled up and inquired about directions.The second report came on October 12th. A 12-year-old girl contacted police. She is the one who said it was a white pickup involved. (There is a previous incident report on this case posted on our website.)The third and fourth reports both came on October 16th. At 4:53 p.m. the suspicious person approached a woman who had been walking on Blue Maple Trail. Then at 7:00 p.m. a female jogger, who was on a path near Turning Lead Road, was contacted.In all cases the females say the driver tended to linger after asking directions, and sometimes contacted them more than once in a short time period.One of the females said the suspicious man \"creped\" her out, and almost all said he made them feel unsafe.",

The woman says a guy knocked on her door claiming to be an employee of Charter Cable. She could see her name on a piece of paper he had attached to a clipboard. The man told the woman for five dollars more a month she could get five more channels. The woman told the man she had no interest in more channels. She says he left and made rude comments as he departed. On November 7th the woman says she called Charter and learned they are not offering the deal suggested to her, that their employees would be wearing a uniform, and they would not be calling at 8:00 in the evening. She describes the man who came to her door as being white, 5'10\", 180 lbs., clean-shaven, with no glasses. He was wearing a gray and blue winter coat.",

Upon arrival, police would contact three 23-year-old females who arrived back at their residence just before 2AM, and to their surprise confronted by Shyon E. Corner making inappropriate comments to them.  Not only was Corner saying things that were not appropriate, he exposed his genitalia.   The unsuspecting females quickly moved into their residence and contacted the police with a specific description of Corner.Police would arrive on scene and find Corner face down in a prone position on the side of a residence.  Once Corner determined that police were attempting to contact him, he would flee the scene; jumping fences as police commanded him to stop.  Corner momentarily eluded police only to be located a short time later by a MPD Sergeant, but Corner would continue his relentless attempt to flee police until he was finally located hiding in thick underbrush near the 300 block N. Carroll Street.  Corner did not comply with officers to show his hands when contacted, but the threat of a Taser quickly changed his demeanor. Corner, when questioned, would deny having run from police and exposing himself to the original complainants.  He did not have a reasonable explanation for his torn clothing, but did state that he was lying in the underbrush to sleep!  A number of officers and a canine were utilized in the search of this subject, and Corner was confined at the Dane County Jail on charges listed above.The Madison Police Department advises citizens to continue to use diligence in reporting suspicious behavior with details to police in order that matters can be investigated immediately.  This case worked extremely well and no individual was injured due to tactical measures used by officers on scene.PO Howard PayneMadison Police Department",

She responded, and they explained they were with \"ASPCA\" - an association for the prevention of cruelty to animals based in New York. The men told the woman they had come to inspect her pets. She let them into her apartment where they proceeded to look at her dog. They then went upstairs to her bedroom to inspect her cat. Their conclusion was the feline was too skinny. About this time the woman realized this situation did not feel right. The men left without committing any crimes, but one did ask the woman if she was a model, and would she want to go on a date. Neither presented any identification.",

Anderson, appauled by being attacked, defends himself by picking up the only item near him (Razor scooter - non-motorize foot bike) and throws it at the suspects to create distance between himself and the attackers/suspects.  After the scooter was thrown, one male suspect (11 year old) inadvertently trips over it as it fell to the ground, and the suspect finds himself beside the scooter; having sustained a lacerated upper lip from the impact of the fall.  That injury would require 5 stitches at the emergency room.  It seems the second male juvenile suspect (13 year old) was an accomplice and very much an instigator of the entire episode with Anderson.  He was charged with party to a crime of both Battery and Disorderly Conduct While Armed!The 37 year old male that was arrested in this scenario would deal with the police after all of the antics of his 11 year old son and 13 year old associate had run their course.  He would be arrested for Intimidating a Victim, Disorderly Conduct, and a Probation Violation/Hold for attempting to confront (in a violent manner) Anderson; thinking that Anderson had in some way attacked his son (11 year old suspect).  Police interviewed several reliable witnesses to make all arrest decisions.  The parents of the two juvenile suspects were counseled about their behavior in the absence of an authoritative figure.",

The officer learned that a motorcyclist and a driver of a passenger vehicle apparently exchanged finger notions and words after the motorcyclist believed the vehicle had cut him off.  The motorcyclist, Dyer, also had a 10 year-old on the his motorcycle and feared the vehicle's driver did an intentional act in cutting him off while eastbound on Williamson St.  When the vehicle and motorcycle came to a traffic stop, Dyer came off his motorcycle and confronted the victim and the victim's passenger.  Dyer grabbed the victim's shirt and punched him.  At this point the officer arrived on scene and stopped this situation from escalating. The motorcyclist expressed remorse for having his 10 year-old passenger witness this incident.  Dyer was transported to the Dane County Jail without incident.",

When officers arrived, they noticed the 16 year-old victim was bleeding and had been battered.  As officers looked for the suspect and attended to the victim, parts of her ear were discovered on the ground.  The incident occurred when the victim tried to leave the abusive suspect, later identified as Singleton.  The violence that Singleton produced entailed throwing an object at the victim, choking her and hitting her.  Eventually as the victim was trying to leave, Singleton dragged her back inside several feet.  As the taxi cab driver witnessed this event, Singleton tried to downplay the event as protecting the victim.  The victim then was held by Singleton who would not let her go.  In holding the victim down, Singleton bit the victim's ear and rolled her over to bite off portions of her other ear.  Madison Fire/Rescue transported the victim to a local hospital, where she still remains.  Singleton was later apprehended.",

Those who fled from the car were chased by the suspects with a pipe or baseball bat.  When officers returned to the scene, all four tires on vehicle had been punctured and were now flat.",

Hogue allegedly got into an argument with the arrested 16-year-old female juvenile about whether or not the arrested 9th grade male had had an altercation with a cousin that also attends Lafollette HS.  The two females get involved in a fight where punches were thrown and High School Administrators had to physically intervene to deescalate this scenario.  Several Principals interjected; one principal had to cover the body of the 16 year old to keep Hogue from continuing to promote the fight.  This resulted in Hogue having an opportunity to kick the head/face of the 16-year-old female while she was being restrained on the ground.  The 16 year old sustained a 3-inch scratch to the right side of her face and nose pain (to be evaluated at a local medical facility).     The 14-year-old male, who is the younger sibling of the arrested 16-year-old female, was arrested on charges of Disorderly Conduct due to his creating a disturbance in the school and attempting to escalate the fight further.

                        "Details": "On October 18th, 2006 at 8:05am, Police were dispatched to 201 S. Gammon Road (Madison Memorial High School) reference a disturbance.  Upon arrival, police would encounter the 3 parties listed above and a host of other agitated involved parties.  Watson allegedly confronts the 9th and 10th graders about spreading a rumor throughout the neighborhood about him.  It seems that there may have been an earlier altercation involving these parties in the recent week, and the basis for the rumor was a matter of contention for Watson.  As this verbal altercation ensued near the cafeteria of the school, Watson would disregard directives by school administrators to cease his threatening behavior, and proceeds to push past both a Principal and Dean to actively involve himself in a fight.  Both administrators of the school had to seek medical attention due to this ill-advised move on the part of Watson.   Watson would be arrested on two counts of Battery To School Employee & DC based on this scenario.   The 16-year-old arrested juvenile would be charged with battery for his involvement in striking a victim.  The 14-year-old male would be charged with DC for his involvement of creating/promoting the disturbance within the school.    Police and school administrators were able to calm this situation, but not without having to deal with a very complex set of circumstances.   Students need to realize that school administrators have the authority and responsibility to keep all within the school safe.  Students should adhere to all school related polices and understand that if they do not, police action will most liked result in serious charges being filed.  This is a situation that should not occur within the confines of school property, but young adults should have a greater opportunity to speak with parents about measures of conflict management/resolution!PO Howard Payne",

The two individuals demanded \"something\" from the 46 year-old male for striking the vehicle and due to him admitting he did not have insurance.  As the three were looking at the minor damage to the car, the two suspects turned on the victim and battered him.  The victim was punched approximately 15-20 times in the head area.  The suspects attempted to take the victim's walking stick, but were unsuccessful in striking him with it.  The suspects stole the victim's cellphone and then fled the area.",

The 21 year old, who is also a wrestler, then put Corona in a headlock. During this time the 21 year old says Mr. Corona was punching wildly, and in fact, one of the blows landed on his (the 21 year old's) nose. Police arrested Corona and Kirchstein despite their claims that they were the ones who were assaulted.",

But on this night he said one of the trio expressed interest in taking possession of his dog. He says this led to the group attacking him. He says he was kicked and punched and later struck multiple times with a fencepost that resembled a baseball bat. During the melee he says his dog was also hit with the chunk of wood. He said he does not have money to take the dog to a vet, and he indicated he and his dog would be moving on, up the highway, after this altercation",

A few minutes later an officer was dispatched to Fish Hatchery Road just north of Wingra Drive after motorists reported the car was now stopped in traffic. The officer found approximately 20 cars backed up behind the suspect vehicle \u2013 all were in the right hand lane of Fish Hatchery. The officer determined a black Mitsubishi Galant (the suspect car) was in drive but not moving because the driver -- who appeared to be asleep -- had his foot on the brake. The officer tried knocking but could not get the driver to respond. Next the officer opened the driver's side door and ordered the driver to put the car in park. The driver responded by swearing at the officer, and by taking his foot off of the brake. The Galant coasted forward and collided with the rear of the officer's squad car. The officer reached across the Mitsubishi and placed it in park. He then tried to remove the suspect from the driver's seat. The suspect responded by placing the vehicle in reverse. The officer next turned off the car. A struggle ensued and the suspect ended up punching the officer in the face multiple times. A second officer arrived and assisted with getting the suspect in custody. The officer suffered a couple of cuts and bruises.",

He told officers that he and others were working near loading docks of a company when the suspect began making racial insults towards him and other employees of color. The victim says the suspect started saying things like, \"Go back to Chicago where you're from,\" while making racial slurs including the \u201cn\u201d word. This was followed by the suspect spraying paint thinner at two of the aforementioned employees. He then threw the spray bottle at the primary victim hitting him in the face. Next the suspect grabbed a sharp piece of metal and started swinging it at the face of the 48-year-old man. The victim blocked the swings with his hand and suffered a puncture wound. At this point other employees broke up the attack. The suspect was arrested at his Fitchburg residence Tuesday evening (July 1st).

This involved the man using some very vulgar language.

In response, the driver picked up his phone and started to call police, but before he could connect the man started punching him repeatedly in the head while the victim was still belted into his driver's seat.

The officers were observing the bar crowd. The men asked to pet the horses, and were given permission to do so. Upon completion of the petting, the suspect slapped one horse very hard on the rump. The mounted officer said on scale of one to ten, this strike was a ten. The officer's horse leapt forward in a dangerous manner, almost causing the officer to be unseated. The officer said such a sudden movement could also endanger community members.The suspect apologized immediately, and was placed under arrest for Battery to a Police Animal.",

Officer Slawek noticed a dog that had jumped into Lake Monona after a duck decoy.  As the dog struggled to get out of the water, the dog's owner dove into the water to render aid.  Officer Slawek noticed now that both the dog and owner were struggling in 10 foot, frigid water.  Nearby was a Martin-Glass company vehicle with a ladder.  Employees of Martin-Glass and Officer Slawek used the ladder to help save the citizen and dog. It was estimated that the dog and citizen were in the water for 5-10 minutes.  Madison Fire/Rescue also responded to the scene.  The Madison Police Department suggests that citizens use extreme caution near the lakes as the warmer weather thins the ice.",

The victim's credit card company called the victim to report suspicious behavior on her account.  Particularly gift cards were purchased at four west side stores, totaling over $500.00.  The victim recalled shopping on 11/30/05 and as she was leaving the store, being approached by the above mentioned suspect.  Thinking back, she believed the encounter was strange because the male had distracted her.  While leaving the foyer, the suspect cut in front of her with a shopping cart and made her focus her attention to the wheels.  In doing so, the suspect also asked the victim for help with this cart, which seemed odd because the victim's hands were full of bags and the suspect's hands were empty.  For a brief moment the victim was turned from the suspect and it is believed the wallet was stolen at this juncture.  The Madison Police Department advises people to be mindful of their belongings, secure their purses and wallets and pay attention to distractions that could have wicked intentions.",

On 2/5/07 an officer took a theft report from a construction site.  The officer alerted several recycling places, as this area has seen a large increase in copper being stolen and sold to recycling businesses.  A short time later a recycling business reported suspicious behavior.  A different officer was dispatched and confirmed that the materials that were trying to be sold to the recycling business, were from the site of the primary officer.  Chatman and Billups were arrested.  Later that day, patrol officers responded to a complaint of three individuals breaking into vehicles.  Those three individuals (Watson, Gehrt and Delao) were contacted and arrested.  As intelligence came in and the investigation continued, the Madison Police Department has learned the five individuals are connected in an unsophisticated way.  No further details are available at this time, as this remains an open investigation.  MPD asks victims of thefts/burglaries to wait to be contacted as officers have property to sort through and are looking for identifying marks.  Additionally, MPD reminds the community (including construction companies) to clearly label, mark or etch their valuables with names and/or driver's license numbers.  This information is the easiest way for law enforcement to track if it is ever reported stolen.",

                        "Details": "The Madison Police Department is investigating a theft ring at area health clubs.  There has been a pattern of thefts from area health clubs, which investigators believe are connected.  Similar cases have been investigated in the Milwaukee area as well.  Two adult black females have been successful in repeatedly slipping past front desk clerks without being seen and then going into locker rooms to break into lockers with bolt cutters.  To assist in the females gaining entrance into the health clubs, a blitz of black male teenage boys distract the front clerk by asking to use the bathroom, borrow a basketball, etc.  The suspects then enter the locker rooms and begin cutting locks and stealing property from within.  The suspects steal car keys, purses, wallets, cell phones and credit cars, etc.  When keys are stolen the suspects use the remote access in the parking lot to then gain entry into vehicles, to steal the car and/or valuables inside.  The suspects are believed to have also made a practice of watching the parking lot for members who arrive to work out and are seen bending down to conceal their purses or wallets under the seats.  The suspects then target those particular vehicles, breaking in car windows and grabbing what they can before fleeing.  In addition, when credit and ATM cards have been stolen, the female suspects have been known to call back the club and purport to be \"fraud alert bank employees\" needing to speak to the unassuming victim still working out.  The victims are paged and are told there is an active fraud going on, by the suspects.  The suspects tell the shocked victim that they need their PIN (personal id number) in order to shut down the account.  After the PIN is given, the suspects use that information for purchasing items via the internet, cash withdrawals from ATMs and other purchases.  The victims often do not think as to how the \"bank employee\" knew they were at the Health Club, until days later.  Also, the victim doesn't bother to cancel the account until several days later, because they already spoke with who they believe was a \"bank employee\".  The female suspects are very mobile and the trail of fraudulent withdrawals and purchases suggest they leave town within an hour of the thefts and continue making illegal transactions on victims' accounts in towns and cities across southern WI for the rest of the day.The Madison Police Department reminds citizens to never give out personal information over the phone, particularly if you are at the victim of a theft.  Also, it is advisable not to leave valuables in vehicles or lockers.",

Upon meeting the victim went to an ATM to withdrawl cash for the purchase.  Originally the victim wanted to make sure the equipment worked, so the two went to an apartment and knocked on a door.  No one answered the door, so the victim trusted the package contained the Nintendo and that it worked.  After the money was exchanged and the two parted, the victim opened the package to find a wrapped up telephone book. It did not plug into a Nintendo.",

The officer, earlier in his shift, took a report in which a similar truck may have been involved in a theft from a construction site. At the time of the traffic stop the driver of the pickup truck, Mr. English, jumped out and began running. Backup officers were able to set up a perimeter and take him into custody in a couple of minutes. Passenger Howland was taken into custody at the scene of the traffic stop. A check on the construction trailer's registration revealed it belongs to Parisi Construction. The officer's earlier call was to the home of a north side businessman. He told police two men sold him an air compressor that the businessman believed might have been stolen. He called police and provided a detailed description of the suspects and the truck in which they were traveling. That information led to the traffic stop.",

The deputy had been shopping with a friend when the purse-snatcher reached into the friend's shopping cart and took off running. The 56-year-old deputy was unable to catch the 14-year-old suspect, but did help direct officers to an area near the mall into which the suspect had gone. A second witness told responding officers that the suspect was now in a nearby video game store. The deputy arrived as the suspect was detained by Madison police. The suspect initially denied culpability, but the deputy said, \"You're a liar. I saw you there (in the store) and I'm the one that was chasing you.\" The young man later admitted to his crime. The victim's purse was found in a trashcan, while her money was in the suspect's pocket.",

A man, who appeared to be very knowledgeable about Synthes made surgical sets, convinced staff he was, in fact, a representative of the manufacturer. Sythes makes sterilized surgical equipment out of titanium and stainless steel. The perpetrator, utilizing a thick Australian accent, used the ruse to get to the area where Synthes sets are housed. Hospital staff say it is not unusual for representatives of certain high-tech companies to arrive on location to inspect their equipment. During this visit the perpetrator also passed himself off to other hospital employees as a new operating room doctor. Following his review of several Synthes sets it was discovered many items were missing including one compete set. The bogus company representative/phony doctor left quickly and was carrying a backpack. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.",

The woman, who had placed her cane and purse inside her shopping cart, pointed out the window in the direction of where he needed to go. As she did so the two females grabbed her purse from the cart. The victim screamed. Madison Police were called as the suspects ran towards East Towne Mall. Responding officers nabbed all three. They had in their possession clothing that is believed to have just been stolen from the Burlington Coat Factory, and keys to a stolen car. The keys had been in a purse that was stolen from East Towne Mall on December 27, 2007.  The male suspect is believed to have had the car (2001 Nissan) until Tuesday January 8th when police recovered it. It was found parked outside the school he (the 17-year-old) attends. The 12 & 16-year-old suspects are banned from East Towne Mall because of prior retail thefts, which is why they were charged with trespassing. The purse that was stolen from the cart at the fabric store was returned to the owner.",

According to a police report, the victim was \"extremely emotionally upset and crying ... having a hard time speaking.\" In between her bursts of tears the responding officer was able to take her statement. The woman reports that she had gone to the Dane County Humane Society on Voges Road on Friday afternoon January 11, 2008. She went armed with reward fliers as she hoped to find her missing dog. She handed these out to many people who were also at the Humane Society. The victim says the next morning (Saturday) she received a call around 9:30 from someone claiming to know who had her dog. The woman agreed to rendezvous\u2019 with the caller. They met up at a convenience store on Maple Grove Road. The caller had brought with him a second individual. The duo told the woman they would take her to the \"guy.\" He purportedly lived at the address on Carling Drive. Once on location one of the two suspects went into the residence with $80 in reward money, which had been given to him by the victim. He came back out and said the \"guy\" would not even let the woman see her dog for $80, that more cash would be needed. She then consented to go to an ATM machine where she withdrew $400. A suspect took the money inside never to be seen again. The victim called the Humane Society to report what was happening. She got a call back from a 911 dispatcher who told her police were on their way. The second suspect then also departed.",

While the investigating officer was taking a statement from the victim and airing on the police radio a description, another officer noticed an individual matching the description, walking nearby.  The individual, identified as Schaeffer, apparently was walking home from a downtown bar and needed a place to stay warm.  It was discovered that the back door to the residence was unlocked, allowing Schaeffer to enter without permission.

The woman confronted the prowler and he claimed to be waiting for a friend. The victim then recognized this person as being the same man she caught peeping in the same daughter's bedroom window in the fall of 2007. She did not report the first incident to the MPD.  This time, after putting two and two together, the woman grabbed her cell phone, called 911, and followed - at a safe distance - the prowler as he began to run down Jacobs Way. She saw him get into a car and speed away. The perpetrator's description is somewhat similar to that of a man who exposed himself to a woman who was running on a bike path near Hammersley Road on Tuesday, April 22nd (see prior incident report); however, it is not known if the cases are connected.",

Officers learned that the suspect driver was traveling northbound on Fish Hatchery Rd and stuck a traffic light at Ann St.  After crashing into this traffic light, causing it to fall over, the suspect began to follow a witness on Fish Hatchery, who also was in a vehicle.  The witness reports that for unknown reasons, the suspect followed him and was taunting him.  The witness was followed down eastbound Badger Rd to Park St.  This continued on Park St all the way to Regent St in which the suspect continued to pull along side the witness vehicle and taunt him.  The witness turned around on Park St and went southbound back to Badger Rd.  Once on Badger Rd. the witness turned on Catalpa and Cypress to again try to avoid the suspect who was still following him.  A Madison Police Officer then spotted the suspect vehicle on Badger Rd and initiated a traffic stop.  Upon activating the emergency lights, the suspect vehicle sped to 30 m.p.h. and did not immediately stop.  The vehicle continued on Badger Rd, eastbound before turning onto Catalpa LN where the suspect eventually stopped at Magnolia LN.  Once the vehicle stopped, the suspect immediately exited his vehicle.  The driver was verbally ordered to return inside his car.  The suspect did not and put his hands in his pockets.  The officer believed that the suspect could have a weapon in his pocket, as he was noncompliant. Because the suspect was not returning to the inside of his car, the officer then ordered him to the ground and to take his hands out of his pockets.  The suspect did not follow the officer\u2019s commands.  The officer continued verbal commands for the suspect to comply until other officers responded.  As other officers arrived for coverage, the initial officer warned the suspect multiple times to get to the ground and comply or he will be tased.  The suspect got into a defensive posture and pointed his finger at the officer.  To prevent an unpredictable physical encounter, the officer deployed the taser to the suspect.  Upon deployment the suspect immediately fell backwards.  In falling backwards the suspect hit his head on the ground. Officers were concerned for this person\u2019s safety that was now momentarily unconscious.  Fire/Rescue was dispatched to the scene for potential injuries that this person incurred.  At this point the suspect is still hospitalized for injuries and charges are pending.",

Fire personnel observed the car swerving and nearly striking an oncoming car, and later going up and over a grassy median. This pursuit started when the crew on Fire Engine #10 came upon the \"disabled\" car. They made their way in heavy traffic up to it, and were advised by dispatch that there maybe a man passed out inside. Firefighters observed a passerby leaning into the passenger window apparently trying to talk with the driver. At that moment the driver sat up and drove off. The crew on #10 followed until the car turned onto Northridge Terrace. The driver killed the engine and got out at the end of the dead end street. Firefighters then used their rig to block the street, and any possible escape route if the motorist tried to drive off again. Madison Police officers arrived and were directed to an apartment building into which the driver had entered. The above subject was located and identified by firefighters as the driver of the car. He was arrested for his sixth offense drunken driving. Madison Police would like to thank Madison Fire personnel for their assistance in the apprehension.",

Red lights and siren were turned on in an attempt to get the van's driver to pull over. Instead the driver accelerated reaching speeds estimated at around 65 to 70 miles per hour. After a few seconds the pursuit was terminated because of wet pavement and heavy fog. However, officers were already in possession of the van's plate number thanks to the work of the concerned citizen. Officers responded to a residence on Chamberlain Avenue, which corresponded to the registered driver's address. They found the van parked at the residence, which is where Mr. Kubitschek has been staying. He had borrowed the van from the home's owner. He was arrested on the above charges. One of two female passengers in the van was also arrested. When it comes to pursuits Madison police are instructed to balance \"the public interests in the apprehension of violators of the law,\" with \"insuring the safety of all persons who might potentially be endangered by the pursuit.\" In this situation it was the officer's determination that postponing apprehension was the best way to protect the public.",

She advised MPD that she recently had made an Internet transaction on Ebay.  She indicated that on 03/30/2005 in the morning hours, she received an email message that appeared to be from the Internet payment service, Pay-Pal.  The message indicated that she needed to update her account, and asked for personal and financial information including the victim's social security number.  The victim indicated she attempted to email the response without her social security number, and the email was not accepted.  She further indicated that after inserting the social security number, the email was accepted and sent.  She indicated later, in the evening hours, she received a phone call from her credit card company regarding suspicious transactions on her account.  She was told that three unauthorized withdrawals had been made on her account.  The unauthorized withdrawals took place at ATM machines in Romania.  The account from which the withdrawals had been made was held in a Madison, WI credit union.  The complainant believes that the email she received was a 'look alike' to an official Pay-Pal email. This is another example of people having their identity stolen and being defrauded by someone using the Internet.",

In various incidents, whether subleasing an apartment, selling something on the Internet or performing another monetary transaction, people have lost money with fake money orders.  The scam takes place when the suspect agrees to purchase an item or sublease and sends the victim a fraudulent money order that appears real.  The money order is for an amount OVER the cost of the item.  The victim then informs the suspect that he/she overpaid.  The suspect then comes up with an excuse as to the overpayment and asks to be sent the balance back in the form of a money order. The Madison Police Department encourages citizens to be careful in making their financial transaction and take measures to verify the money is legitimate.",

The victim is then to take the artificial check to the bank, cash it and withdraw a money order to return to the fraudulent company in increments.  In all, this victim lost over $10,000 believing that lottery money would be returning.Specifically the scam operated with some of the following language: \u001cAfter numerous attempts to reach you through phone have failed we are pleased to inform you through this letter that our network system shows you as a winner of an unclaimed winning prize money in the amount of $50,000 USD.  Our system indicates that you were selected as a winner on February 14, 2005.  The letter also states that it is part of our job to inform you of the international law guiding the fair personal collection of cash prizes.  The international law requires that a winner pay a processing/clearance fee before funds are released.  The law also prevents you from paying with your personal money but from your winning money.  As part of our security protocol, your file as been assigned to an international claim agent furthermore should there be any change of address do inform your claims agent as soon as possible . . . \"As the Madison Police Department investigates this and other financial fraudulent cases, we urge citizens to use extreme caution in any \"get rich\" fast schemes.",

The following day, the complainant checked her account information online, and learned that her bank account had been drained of all funds.  The loss was in excess of $3,000.

When the skeptical seller states that a credit card would not be feasible, the prospective \"buyer\" reads a fictitious credit card number and states that they will have a bank call the seller.  A third party identifying himself or herself as a bank employee makes a three-way call to the seller indicating that the credit card is legitimate. So far no transactions have been made.  The bank indicates that the transaction would never occur via phone and furthermore would not happen after normal business hours.",

                        "Details": "In recent weeks, a number of theft by fraud cases have been reported to the Madison Police Department.  The suspects utilize local newspapers and find individuals that are attempting to arrange for their vehicles to be sold & then contact the potential seller(s).  The suspect(s) (Female voice with heavy accent claiming to be from the State of Michigan in some instances) would call the owner(s) of the vehicle(s) and usually negotiate the price that they would like to pay the seller (usually offering more than the seller was originally asking), and all parties agree to the sale.  The suspects then, to make the seller more comfortable, would make a conference call to an alleged banking institution where a third party (usually a male voice - Caribbean sounding) would allow the seller to hear that there were ample funds within an account to cover the price of the vehicle that would be purchased.  There would be discussions that the seller would be privy to hearing about fund verification at the banking institution under a specified account number (later determined to not be valid) and the suspect would then set up a meet place for the vehicle to be delivered.  The suspect would arrived at the meet location (M/B, Approx 25yrs, 6'03, 170-180lbs) and give the seller a piece of paper advising the seller to go to the specified banking institution and retrieve the sale amount of the vehicle from the account, while the suspect would then take possession of 1. The vehicle/keys & 2. The title of ownership of car.  The suspect would sign this paperwork as if it were a legal document and would require the seller of the vehicle to do the same.  After the car had been turned over from the legitimate seller, they would find out later that there were no funds at the banking institution under the account number that was stated on the paper!People should know that there were no legitimate calls made to any banking institution, and the suspects in this scenario are taking full advantage of people who are not utilizing conventional means of transferring property.  Please use care when entering into any agreement with anyone, and be extremely careful in the transfer of any property without adequately determining whether or not funds are absolutely secure!  The Madison Police Department is continuing to investigate this matter.",

The victim then sent a return, valid check, back to the suspect for the overdue amount . . . only to be never heard from again.

He reported that a male came to his door at approximately 05:30am on 09/25/05, and indicated that he was locked out of his residence and needed money for a locksmith.  The caller reported that he provided money to the subject.  Over the last few months there have been a number of cases where a subject knocks on the door of a residence and tells people he is a neighbor who lives down the street and is locked out of his house.  He then indicates that a locksmith is on the way but the locksmith requires payment in advance.  He asks if he can borrow the money and that as soon as he's in the house he will get his money and return and repay the neighbor. In the past this scheme has taken place in the Williamson St. area.  In the cases reported to the Madison no one has ever been repaid.",

From New Jersey they paid over $1,000 to come to Madison with their passport to obtain a valid WI driver's license.  The individuals, along with their passports, received actual utility bills and put their names on it before going to WI DOT.  Once at WI DOT they tried to obtain driver's licenses using their passports and now the altered utility bill.  The individuals knew that WI is one of 11 states where a driver's license is issued with a proof of residency (utility bill) and photo id (passport).  No arrests have been made and no charges have been filed.  This incident is still under investigation.",

He indicated over the weekend, he had been looking on E-Bay, and looked at items on an E-Bay auction.  He reported that the auction site listed higher ticket items, such as audiovisual equipment, copiers, and bicycles.  He also observed that the items for bid did not appear to be the primary business of the seller.  The complainant indicated that he bid on several of the items and noticed that someone else always bid higher, driving the price up.  He became suspicious and contacted E-bay. He learned that an unauthorized entity had attached items for auction onto legitimate E-Bay sites.  He  noted that the unauthorized sites have very sophisticated graphics that were nearly identical to the legitimate sites.  He also noted that the unauthorized sites asked people to send a cashier's check or certified check to a specific address rather than use the PayPal system for payment.  The complainant finished his statement by writing that he should have recognized the old maximism, \"If it's too good to be true, it probably isn't true!\"In another Internet fraud that Madison Police learned about  a citizen living outside of the City but in Dane County advertised two puppies for sale.  The asking price on the puppies was $375 each.  She received an email response from someone who indicated they wanted to buy the puppies and would send travelers checks for payment.  $4000 in travelers checks arrived at the seller's address without any return address.  The seller was then  told by email to cash the travelers checks and send the overpayment by Western Union to a specific address.  The travelers checks turned out to be counterfeit.  The seller determined this by contacting the company that was listed on the travelers checks.  The perspective buyer was told via email that the Madison Police Dept had been notified of the situation and all correspondence stopped.",

It was learned that the female befriended a male, via the internet, indicating he was from Nigeria.  After months of \"chatting\", via the internet, the male sent the female a check worth $29,925 to deposit in the United States because he \"couldn't\" in Nigeria.  In exchange for cashing the check, the female was going to receive $1,500.  Additionally, the check appeared valid from the U.S. Treasury.  A few days after depositing the check and having the money wired to the suspect, the bank notified the victim saying she had deposited a fraudulent check.  The bank indicates the female now owes $29,925 back to the bank.  Madison Police have also learned that suspects in this type of scheme are targeting \"divorce type chat rooms\" to befriend someone and then ask for this type of \"help\" in depositing money.  The Madison Police Department strongly urges people to be on guard of claims to give you money for cashing checks . . . especially from a stranger in Nigeria or any foreign country.",

These individuals have not given their private information away, but the fear is that numerous others have.  At this point it is too early to tell.  At issue is an automated phone call to citizens indicating there is trouble with their bank account.  The automated call gives the citizen a number to call and upon calling that number asks for the customers account number and pin.  Citizens should know that banks will never ask for an account number and pin and providing that in this fraud case could be extremely costly.  Victims of this fraud won't know until funds have been drained or access is denied on their credit cards/accounts.  This is a sophisticated scam and citizens with accounts in other financial institutions should also be aware of this scam and alert to not to give their private information away.",

The bills turned out to be counterfeit. In fact, the responding officer reported the seven were of very poor quality. They had the same serial number, and were actually comprised of two pieces of paper. The front part of the bogus c-note, and the back were glued together.",

The victim said she had not lost a purse. A second suspect, who pretended not to know the first, then showed up with a purse. In the ruse, it was stated $100,000 was in the purse. The first suspect indicated the money was likely from some type of criminal enterprise, but said they should split it between the three of them. In order to keep the money however, the first suspect insisted each of the other two women (1 the victim, 1 suspect #2) withdraw $12,000 each from their bank accounts. The suspect indicated serial numbers from the windrawn funds could be mixed with those in the purse. The victim was confused by this logic, but after suspect number 2 appeared to withdraw funds from her account, she (the victim) did the same. The first suspect took the money saying she would be back as soon as she recorded the serial numbers. She did not return. The second suspect also left. The victim stood in the parking lot, and when police arrived she was very shaken by the ordeal",

Through DNA evidence investigators were able to identify Melendez-Valladares as the suspect in a stranger sexual assault case that occurred in the early morning hours of December 7, 2001.  A 22 year-old female had been walking home when Melendez-Valladares pulled her into a remote area behind some buildings and brutally sexually assaulted her.  At the time, this incident received widespread media attention.  The DNA \"hit\" on Melendez-Valladares occurred while he was already serving prison time in Indiana for a similar crime in 2003.  In 2017, when Melendez-Valladares completes his prison time in Indiana, he will then be transported to Wisconsin to serve 65 years for this case and then 25 years of supervised release.  After the combined 90 years, Melendez-Valladares will be turned over to the federal government for being a repeat, illegal-alien offender.    Essentially this has become a life sentence.  The DNA evidence collected from the victim was entered with the state crime lab.  That information is then continuously checked nationally in the \"CODIS\" system to compare with other DNA entered daily.",

This time the scene played out inside the Northport Laundry, 1417 Northport Drive. The suspect tried to get the victim to go into a bathroom. Instead she ran out of the business and yelled for help. The suspect ran off.A Madison police officer had a hunch he might know who the suspect was in these two cases based on past contact he had had with a 16 year old. He gave a name to detectives, and the suspect's photo was picked out of a line-up by one of the victims.Around 7:20 p.m.  Thursday evening (October 18, 2007) detectives made contact with the suspect at his residence and he was arrested.",

It then crashed into the curb and a fire hydrant at the intersection of Clyde Gallagher and Union Street after failing to negotiate a curb. The 4 occupants of the vehicle are listed above.They all fled the scene on foot. The driver was identified as a 14-year-old male. He was located later in the day by officers at a relative's residence. He was taken to a hospital and treated in the emergency room because he complained of head pain related to hitting the steering wheel. The 2 younger juveniles were apprehended and then released to parents. A 15-year-old from Minnesota remains at large at this time. The battery charge was related to the fight that occurred in the park. The victim in that incident received a minor injury. The vehicle involved was a 1997 Dodge minivan. It suffered extensive front-end damage and a snapped front axle. It appears the vehicle was traveling in excess of 80 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone.",

As the investigation began, it was learned that there was a traffic crash the night prior (9/13) at approximately 9:06 p.m. in which a 2001 Ford Focus crashed into the airport perimeter fence on the southbound side of Hwy 51.  During that accident investigation, officers dealt with this scene, investigated it, interviewed the driver and issued a citation for \"inattentive driving\".  The vehicle was towed away and the driver left upon release from the police, via others who were not present during the crash.  Detectives interviewed this driver this morning and let him go as no charges have been filed.  This remains an ongoing investigation and anyone with further information is encouraged to contact Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.  An autopsy will be performed tomorrow.

                        "Details": "In the form of a horrific, tragic event, three people lost their lives due to an accidental electrocution.  Three individuals were waiting for a bus on N. Sherman Ave.  As the bus approached, an electrical utility pole was struck by lightening, causing a live wire to touch the ground. That wire ended up in a flooded portion of the curb, that was very deep in water. A female and her child were electrocuted.  A small child standing to get on the bus tried to enter the water, but was spared life.  A hero on the bus witnessed what transpired and got off the bus to render aid.  That hero also was electrocuted.  The heroic bus driver also attempted to perform a rescue by exiting the bus, but was shocked and fell back into the bus.  Taken to the hospital were the child and bus driver and their condition is unknown at this time.  Several officers were on scene immediately.  Other people were on the bus and they were uninjured.  The coroner's office is handling the autopsy, identification of the bodies and the notification to survivors.  There were numerous heavy hearts on scene trying to comprehend this tragedy. ***UPDATE***  For those interested in helping with this devastation to the affected families, contributions can be made to ANY Heartland Credit Union.  Please use the \"Bus Tragedy Fund\" to help support these families and the survivors.  It has been learned that the deceased were traveling together and were friends.  An engaged couple were traveling with a mother and the mother's two children.  When the heavy rain fell and the bus arrived, everyone made a dash for the bus.  As previously stated, lightening struck a utility pole, causing a live wire to lay on the ground in deep water.  The seven year-old child went through the water, following Dobbs and his fiance and received a survivable shock.  The engaged couple saw the child shocked and Dobbs heroically assisted the seven year-old boy onto the bus.  Dobbs saw Dancey fall into the water, with the toddler, and attempted a rescue.  As Dobbs went into the water, he was electrocuted as well.  The seven year-old attempted to go and save his mother, but Dobb's fiance, who was still on the bus, pulled the seven year-old back.  The bus driver also attempted a rescue, was shocked and fell back into the bus.  The bus driver secured the doors, so no one else would go into the water.   The seven year-old is expected to be released from the hospital today or tomorrow.  The seven year-old has an eight and twelve year-old sibling.  They are being taken care of by relatives.",

In other cases it appears a pellet gun may have been used. At this time there is not a count as to how many vehicles have been hit as most victims were given self-reports to fill out.  Because of the mobility of the suspects and how quickly property is damaged, this is a difficult crime to catch someone in the act of committing.  The Madison Police Department advises that citizens report license plate numbers and vehicle descriptions of suspicious behavior to assist in our investigation.  Anyone with information is encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.  Callers can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a cash reward.",

New damage estimates, stemming from that crime spree, are being placed at around 100,000.Madison Police Detectives have also connected the three young men to vandalism incident at East High School. It occurred this past weekend the same morning as the Bridges vandalism. In the East High case, the suspects were able to get inside the school, and one of the three \u2013 the 16 year-old suspect \u2013 is believed to have scrawled graffiti, which was racist in nature.The trio is also the focus of a vandalism investigation being conducted by the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department.The Madison Police Department MPD would like to thank citizens who helped identify the suspects, including the father of one.Last evening, after viewing surveillance footage broad on local news stations, he called the MPD and said one of the persons of interest seen on a broad is his son.The Madison cases are still under investigation, but it is probable the MPD will ask the District Attorney to file several charges against each teen including: Burglary, multiple counts of Operating a Motor Vehicle Without Owner\u2019s Consent, and multiple felony Criminal Damage to Property counts.As for the East High graffiti it is likely the MPD will ask that suspect be charged with Graffiti, with a Hate Crime enhancer.ORIGINAL RELEASEOn Saturday morning, and 5:39 a.m., Madison Police were dispatched to the Bridges Golf Course, 2702 Shopko Drive, after employees discovered significant vandalism had been done overnight. Criminals took a John Deere tractor, and a bobcat from the maintenance shed and drove them onto the course. Several trees were uprooted, and extensive damage was done to the 17th tee, par four, and to the 16th hole. Employees estimate damage to these two areas at 25,000. In addition, at least two irrigation heads were damaged, two vehicles - that had been parked by the maintenance shed - were overturned, and a golf cart taken for a joy ride. Golf clubs and a couple of golf bags were also stolen during the crime spree.",

A responding officer noticed Osborne walking westbound on Raymond Rd just before Lewon Lane.  The officer confronted Osborne verbally and told him to stop for questioning.  Osborne took off running westbound on Raymond.  As he approached Lewon Lane Osborne hit a taxicab that was stopped in the crosswalk.  Osborne continued running, this time out into traffic on Raymond Rd where a car stopped and Osborne jumped over the hood.  He then reversed and went northbound on Lewon and turned eastbound on Black Oak Drive, where he suspiciously reached into his pocket/waistband.  No weapon is seen at this time.  Once on Black Oak Drive, Osborne squares off on the officer still pursuing him on foot.  Osborne continued to refuse orders to stop and get to the ground.  The officer used a baton and struck Osborn on the knee to attempt to apprehend him.  Osborne continued to defy orders and another responding officer deployed a Taser.  Once the Taser was deployed Osborne was immediately taken into custody without further incident.  He was transported to the Dane County Jail.",

Officers learned that the female victim had exited the bus at the transfer point and noticed four black males watching her and not interested in any bus activity.  The victim crossed Tokay Blvd to enter her car, which was parked in a parking lot.  As the victim entered her car, the same males approached her and took her purse, after a brief struggle in which the victim was thrown to the ground.  The victim yelled out what was going on as the suspects were fleeing northbound on foot.  A passerby picked the victim up her a vehicle and they were able to track the suspects briefly.  The suspects continued to flee into a business where officers set up a perimeter.  As the suspects left the business, the officers caught them.  This remains an ongoing investigation.",

It seems that the victims were walking southbound in the 10 Block of  N. Baldwin Street when they were encountered by the suspects.  One victim (28 year old male) was struck to the back of the head, thrown on  the hood of a car, and forced to relinquish his wallet.  The second victim (30 year old male) gave a very similar story in that he was struck to the back of the head, punched in the face, and after falling to ground was continually kicked.  The suspects then took his wallet and immediately ran westbound on E. Mifflin Street.  The two victims both stated that based on how dark it was, coupled with the fact they were both shocked this actually happened, they could not describe the suspects with any facial feature specifics.  The suspects were only described as college aged and wearing spring windbreaker-type jackets and blue jeans.  An independent witness also reported to police that he had witnessed the attack on the two male victims, and could see both were bleeding after the robbery!This matter is under investigation, and the Madison Police Department ask that anyone with additional information contact Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.  Callers can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a cash reward for information.PO Howard Payne",

The victim struggled and was struck in the face with the weapon. The suspect fled in the victim's vehicle. Officers located the vehicle and the suspect was taken into custody a short time later.**** UPDATE ****A Madison Police Officer/K-9 Unit was blocks away when this original call for service came in.  The officer responded and checked on the victim's condition and assessed that he would be ok, with minor injuries.  The officer and K-9 followed the direction of travel for the carjacked vehicle.  Monona Police made a traffic stop on the stolen vehicle a short time later and the suspect fled on foot.  The Madison Police Officer and K-9 engaged in a track.  The K-9 led the handler to an area where the suspect was hiding in some bushes.  Several verbal commands were given to the suspect who did not comply and at one point said he was passed out.  The officer was concerned that the suspect did not show his hands because there was a report of the suspect having a firearm.  After several commands and no compliance, the officer released his K-9.  The K-9 went into the bushes, bit the suspect on the shoulder and dragged him out of the bushes where he was arrested without further incident.  A gun was located on the ground at the scene.",

The suspect left as the victim did not have the right brand.  The suspect left and made a cell phone call.  Shortly after, the suspect and two other suspects returned in a car and confronted the victim and his friends to which he re-joined with.  Each of the suspects confronted the males and a fight ensued.  At one point a suspect pulled a knife on a victim and demanded money.  The victim punched the suspect, got free and fled before calling police.  This case still remains under investigation.

The PEO immediately recognized the illegally parked van as matching the description of the van being sought in the Loan Max armed robbery. As the PEO was contacting police dispatch about his find the suspect showed up and attempted to get back into the van. At the time the PEO did not know this was the suspect, but he informed the woman she could come no closer to the van because it was now the subject of a police investigation. She left. MPD Officers arrived to back-up the PEO. A short time later the suspect was found, and arrested on Allied Drive. It should be noted Lilac Lane and Allied Drive are not far apart.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At approximately 4pm today, Madison Police responded to a report of an armed robbery at the Loan Max, 3066 E. Washington Ave.  The clerk reported being robbed by the above-described subject who was armed with a knife.  The suspect's face was covered at the time of the robbery.

An employee told police the suspect had attacked him with a hammer, and he believes that had he not ducked he would have been hit in the head. During this confrontation the victim says the suspect continued to swing the hammer and threaten his (the victim's) life. He went on to explain that he and the suspect ended up wrestling on the floor, and that he (the victim) eventually ran out of the store to seek help. As he did this the suspect fled. The victim saw the suspect run and seek refuge in a nearby apartment building. He (the victim) called 911. Officers utilized the skills of Madison Police K9 Johnny to search the apartment building. In a laundry area K9 Johnny stuck his nose into the crack of a bathroom door. K9 Johnny began to growl. A voice from inside the bathroom said something to the effect of, \"get your dog out of here.\" The suspect was then arrested.",

The man ordered her twice to give up her purse, but the woman recognized his weapon as being a cap gun, and responded to both of his requests with, \"No, that's a fake gun.\" She then entered the store, as did the man who had accosted her. He next ordered store staff to open the register. An employee looked at his gun, and made the same observation as the woman -- a guy with a very fake appearing weapon was confronting him. This employee then grabbed a large stick and chased the perpetrator out of the store.",

                        "Details": "On June 16th, 2008 at approximately 9:15AM, Madison Police were dispatched to an Armed Robbery at the Mobile Gas Station (3505 E. Washington Avenue).   Police would arrive obtaining a good description of the suspect and information that the suspect fled on foot just north of the robbery scene with an undisclosed amount of cash.  Officers would canvass the area and based on a good description of the suspect, a driver for Madison Metro Bus Company would pick up an individual matching the described likeness just blocks away.  The driver did an outstanding job in alerting Madison Metro of this information, and Police would respond to the 1600 Block of S. Stoughton Road to contact this potential suspect.A male subject identified as Corey L. Holly attempted to exit the bus as Officers were converging to contact him, but after a minor struggle Holly would be detained at 10:32AM.  Pending further investigative measures by both Officers and Detectives, Holly would be placed under arrest at 11:01AM for the robbery.  It should be known that this Mobile Gas Station has been robbed on two other occasions (May 9th 2008 & June 6th, 2008), and Detectives continue to investigate this matter to determine a possible connection involving Holly.  This case reflected astute actions on the part of the Bus Driver, and solid work on the part of police/witnesses to make an arrest in this matter.  If it were not for citizens remaining vigilant in their observations of this suspect, it would have been much more difficult for police to effect an arrest in this scenario. Holly was arrested in August of 2007 on Armed Robbery charges and extended a one-year sentence with Huber; which he began serving in February of 2008. PO Howard PayneMadison Police Department",

A loaded gun was recovered.  Suspect #2 attempted to grab the cash drawer from the concession area, but was stopped and by cinema employees and some citizens.  He was then arrested by Madison Police Officers.  Both suspects were taken to the Dane County Jail.  All of the cash was recovered and no serious injuries were reported.  The investigation is ongoing.",

Hopkins was tased a third time, went to the ground and got back up.  The officer physically engaged Hopkins again and was able to gain control.

TEST Officers found offenders were averaging 15 miles per hour over that speed limit, with one driver clocking in at 20 over. Officers report that youngsters and their parents were often trying to cross Olin Avenue at the same time some motorists saw fit to speed. This Speedwave was in response to concerns for the safety of these pool patrons, specifically the children. Very young, often unescorted boys and girls frequent the area and cross Olin Avenue unassisted.  The Madison Police Department would ask drivers to remember the pool is now open, and to be cognizant of increased pedestrian traffic.",

Badger Rd. approaching Fish Hatchery Rd. The Madison officer was in the area, saw the speeding car, and was advised Town officers were requesting his assistance. The pursuit route went from Fish Hatchery Rd. onto the West Beltline where speeds were in the 90 to 100 M.P.H. range were noted. The Chevy then got off at Seminole Highway and made its way to Nakoma Road where speeds were clocked between 50 to 60 M.P.H.  As officers approached Monroe Street they were advised to terminate the pursuit. Officers, now driving at the legal speed limit, continued in the direction of the speeding car and found that it had collided with the porch of rental home at 125 N. Randall Ave. It appears cinder blocks from the porch then flew off and hit a legally parked truck. It belongs to a UW student who lives in the home that was hit. The crash woke him up, and he spotted the driver of the speeding car leaving the scene on foot. The student chased and detained the suspect until Madison police could take over for him. The student is in the Naval ROTC and says he is in pretty decent shape from program training. A Madison Sgt., at the scene, is recommending the student receive a citizen commendation for his aid in the apprehension. It should be noted that a desk and a chair that had been outside the home that was struck were demolished in the incident. The ROTC student says he and his roommates were undecided as to whether the items should be kept or tossed and the crash resolved that issue.",

Although charges have been filed against the 3 individuals listed above, there is a continuing investigative effort within several Dane County Police agencies, and additional suspects/charges may be forthcoming; pending Dane County District Attorney review of these matters.On February 21st of  2007, Madison Police Officer Steven Magyera was conducting surveillance based on information that had been developed in this case, and his keen observation of a suspicious vehicle (later determined to be reported stolen) led to the arrests being made.  There have been many Officers/Detectives from many Departments that have played significant roles in this cumbersome investigation, and the communication between the agencies has been the most important factor impacting law enforcement being able to keep all communities safe.  As always, if anyone has any additional information about this matter, they are asked to call any of the respective agencies above or contact the Madison Police Department Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.PO Howard Payne",

The officer believed a burglary may be in progress and called for additional officers.  The City Garage is surrounded by fencing and has buildings on the land.  The officer and police K-9 entered the fenced area and gave several verbal commands that a search would be underway with a dog.  Eventually the suspect, Strassburger, was located outside, hiding behind some equipment.  Strassburger did not have permission to be inside this compound.  The K-9, Greg, bit Strassburger upon finding him.  Strassburger was arrested and taken to a local hospital as per routine after a bite.  No major injuries resulted in this incident.",

It's believed the criminal/criminals used the \"pick\" cart to getaway with the safes. The \"pick\" cart is what employees use to pick up balls from the driving range. The suspect/suspects likely loaded the safes on the \"pick\" cart and drove it across the golf course using a bike/ped path. It looks like they drove the \"pick\" cart over a bike/ped bridge to an area close to Melvin Court. It's assumed a get-away car was parked there. The \"pick\" cart was driven into some high weeds in the direction of a creek and abandoned.",

On the porch of said residence a couple of fairly good clues were discovered -- a pair of snow covered Reebok sneakers, and a long flat-head screwdriver. A Madison Police Investigator later determined the sneaker tread on the Reeboks and the fresh footprints in the snow were an exact match. Police knocked on the door of the home, and the teen's parents called the young man downstairs. He was arrested.",

Officers determined that two businesses -- Cosmo Pro Beauty & Factory Card Outlet -- were the latest targets in a recent rash of \"smash and grab\" burglaries (so named because perpetrators break out glass doors/windows with various objects and then get in and out of businesses in a matter of minutes -- often with stolen merchandise or money in hand). While processing the scene officers observed a '94 Cadillac speeding eastbound on Odana Road. Police followed the car at speeds of just over 40 M.P.H. while attempting to get its\u2019 driver to pull over. Instead of complying the driver drove south on Whitney, then east on Gilbert Road. On Gilbert he pulled into an apartment complex parking lot where he ditched the car. He and at least two co-conspirators took off running. The first officer on scene gave chase. The foot pursuit was about a 100-yard dash, and in the end the officer won taking the driver of the get-away car into custody. Other officers, with the help of a K9's nose, tracked a possible second perpetrator for around an hour and 50 minutes. This took them to a residence on Russett Road. Inside this home a suspect was identified, but as of this writing he has not been arrested.  A look inside the Cady, and cursory search of the area near the chase scene, netted evidence from several recent area burglaries (above and beyond the two that were the basis of this call). The arrested suspect, Mr. Starks, told police he had used heroin prior before getting behind the wheel and that was the basis for the OMVWI count.",

Several businesses at this address had doors shattered and electronics stolen. A getaway car was found at the scene. Investigators would recover a variety of stolen electronics -- including laptop computers -- from inside the '98 Mercury Mystique. A subsequent investigation led to the arrest of Mr. Raheem Blue. The MPD is asking that both Mr. Franklin and Mr. Blue be charged with 13 counts of burglary stemming from the Ganser Way crime spree. They (Mr. Franklin & Mr. Blue) are also considered suspects in other break-ins. Detectives working recent burglaries advise that portable electronics \u2013 like laptops \u2013 are the targets of most break-ins. They advise citizens to record serial numbers on these items, and to store them in safe areas out of easy view.The Madison Police Department set up the Blue Net Task Force in direct response to the escalating number of commercial and residential burglaries in recent months.",

                        "Details": "(UPDATED WEDNESDAY JULY 23, 2008)Early this morning (July 23, 2008) Madison Police arrested a 16-year-old suspect. He is believed to be one of two burglars involved in this smash-and-grab case. Members of the Blue Net Burglary Task Force became aware of the suspect's name following a citizen tip that came in last night.  The teen was arrested after a traffic stop. It was made at 2:08 a.m. near the intersection of Northport and Troy Drives.   In the trunk of the car he was driving were some of the computers and monitors stolen from Byte Sized Solutions.The investigation is continuing as detectives look to identify a second perpetrator, and recover more stolen items. They would ask anyone who has recently purchased computer equipment from a private party - particularly any teenagers - to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.(ORIGINAL RELEASE)On Sunday morning, around 7:33 a.m., Madison Police responded to a computer sales and service store on Cottage Grove Road to take a report on a burglary that happened a couple of hours prior. Officers discovered a large rock had been tossed through a double-paned glass door. Computer equipment valued at $30,000 - belonging to both the business' owner and customers - was stolen. It appears the motion sensor on a burglar alarm did not function. If it had it is possible the thieves would have been scared off, as police would have been notified. Anyone with information on this crime is urged to call Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014. Callers can remain anonymous and maybe eligible for up to a $1,000 reward.",

The off-duty officer, sensing this was not an official police car refused to pull over and called the 9-1-1 Center to verify if an officer was attempting a traffic stop at this location.  Eventually the suspect, later id'd as Kay, sped past the off-duty officer who took down the license plate number. Madison Officers traced the license plate number back to Kay and made contact with Kay at his residence.  Kay, a security guard, was arrested on the above charge and was transported to the Dane County Jail without incident.",

The officer slowed for observance and was approached by a vehicle, later to learn that Goodwan was the driver.  Goodwan indicated he had almost been in a crash due to another vehicle that he pointed out to the officer.  The officer pulled over the other suspect vehicle.  Goodwan followed the officer and was ordered to stay in his vehicle while the officer conducted an investigation.  When asked for id, Goodwan stated he did not have any with him and gave a fake name, arousing suspicion.  Goodwan was told to stay at the scene of the traffic stop of the other vehicle.  Goodwan left the scene and the officer gave chase.  With lights and siren activated, the officer chased Goodwan down Packers to Schlimgen to Loftsgordon.  In the 1800 block of Loftsgordon, Goodwan crashed his vehicle into a tree and then quickly fled on foot.  Another responding officer learned the direction of travel and description of Goodwan and caught him in a residential area. A K-9 was called to the scene to evaluate Goodwan's vehicle, in which marijuana was located.  Goodwan complained of minor injuries.  Fire/Rescue transported Goodwan to a local hospital where he was treated and released to officers waiting to take him to jail.",

                        "Details": "OPERATION DUCK\"On Tuesday afternoon July 24th members of the Madison Police Department's Traffic Enforcement Safety Team (TEST) implemented \"Operation Duck\" along Midvale Blvd., across from Hilldale Mall. An undercover officer was used to educate motorists about pedestrian safety. The officer would step out and walk a crosswalk as vehicles approached. Vehicles that did not stop and yield to the pedestrian \"duck\" were contacted by \"chase\" officers. These officers were both on motorcycles and in squad cars. A half-dozen offenders were issued $140.50 citations. Failure to \"yield the right of way\" to a pedestrian is also a four point driving infraction.The following is what TEST officers developed as background for the \"Duck\" program:Problem: Pedestrians say they are afraid to start crossing the street because either the cars won\u2019t stop or if one car stops- they get stuck in the middle of the road because other motor vehicle operators won\u2019t stop. Pedestrians state they cross mid-block because there are gaps in traffic and they can get across easier than at the crosswalk. Motorists are confused and say they do not stop because they fear they might get rear ended, the car behind them might go around them and hit the pedestrian, or the pedestrian won\u2019t cross when they do stop for them.  Many of the areas from which we receive these complaints do not have the pedestrian traffic volume to make enforcement productive.  Operation Duck is meant to increase that productivity in a manner that is fair to motorists by focusing only on overly aggressive driving behaviors.Goal:  Education, clarification and enforcement of pedestrian safety and pedestrian and motor vehicle laws pertaining to \u201cyielding the right of way\u201d.",

The car in question was westbound and its speed reached approximately 110 miles per hour. Officers --who already had the plate number of the '92 Olds Regency -- determined it was not safe to continue the pursuit and it was terminated. At 12:52 a.m. a Dane County Sheriff's Deputy spotted the \u201992 Olds in a ditch along Highway 12 near County Highway K. A Mt. Horeb police officer arrived with a tracking dog, and the suspects were taken into custody shortly after 2:00 a.m. Both were extremely cold.",

The MPD has been working with other city and private agencies/groups (i.e. Public Health Department, Joining Forces for Families (JFF) etc.) to combat the area's prostitution issues. Beyond enforcement this Coordinated Community Response (CCR) to prostitution utilizes a couple of programs to help those involved. A Women's Workshop is held Saturday evenings at the JFF office (2501 Fish Hatchery Road). It is at these gatherings that women can access resources like HIV testing, counseling, as well as securing shelter. The other prong of the proactive approach is the J.O.H.N. course. The Joining and Organizing Healthy Neighborhoods program is for males arrested -- like those from this latest sting -- for soliciting prostitutes.  It is voluntary. If those enrolled complete the course, and have no negative contacts with police for one year, then the $676.00 citation is nullified.",

OCTOBER 17TH**********A Madison police detective believes there are similarities between this case and another attack on a woman that occurred December 5, 2006 on Jana Lane. In the Jana Lane incident a 25-year-old woman suffered serious injuries during a violent sexual assault. A stranger had gotten into her residence through an unlocked door. The woman who was attacked this past weekend lives but a block from the location of the Jana Lane assault. In this latest case the locked door to the residence was kicked in. Police believe the attacker was scared off because of screams of children who were in the residence. The suspect description in both cases is somewhat similar, and the attacks happened at the same time of day (around 5:30 a.m.) Madison police believe the suspect has been hanging around the area and citizens may have information that could help lead to his identification. Anyone with information is strongly urged to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Callers can remain anonymous and maybe eligible for a case reward.------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL RELEASE FROM MONDAY OCTOBER 15THOn October 13th at 5:34 a.m. a woman reported to Madison police that a man had kicked in the door to her apartment and attacked her. She told responding officers that the suspect, who she says she did not know, pushed her, struck her, kicked her, and put his hands around her neck. She says she screamed and he eventually fled. Nothing was stolen, and the victim told police she did not believe the suspect was trying to sexually assault her. A detective has been assigned to the case.",

                        "Victim": "n/a",
                        "Details": "On 11/24/05 Madison Police investigated what originally was believed to be an elder abuse investigation.  A 90 year-old female was transported to a local hospital via a private ambulance service, to which she later died due to complications of her health.  Through a lengthy investigation it was learned that the mother had become gravely ill in the midst of her two daughters, ages 53 and 54, who have features of being developmentally disabled.  When officers checked the welfare of the two female daughters, residing on the eastside, they were surprised as to the living conditions that the mother and daughters lived in.  There was exposed wiring, a non-operable refrigerator, broken hot water heater, fecal matter on the floor, floorboards exposed and a house that was layered in dirt.  The television had not worked in decades and there was no radio in the home.  It was learned that one of the female daughters, age 54, had not been outside of the house in an estimated 15-20 years.  She looked forward to a simple wave to the postman everyday as he had the same route for eight years.  Neighbors did not know she existed.  The 53 year-old daughter occasionally went outside to the backyard or periodically shoveled, but quickly ran inside if ever approached by someone else.  It is believed she had not left her home/yard since 1983.  Previously she had resided outside the home, but returned to care for her father, who died in 1985.  Both daughters stated they had never been to the doctor.  The 53 year-old daughter did go to Madison East High School, which would have been her last public contact/record.  The family was able to pay for bills, including groceries and milk that were delivered to the house by Sentry and Golden Gernsey, from the social security payments that were directly deposited into an account.  Officers were careful in approaching the daughters as to not upset them.  It was clear from their very white skin that they had not left their home.  It was also clear that they were unable to care for themselves alone.  Officers worked very closely with social workers to ensure their futures would be safe.  Currently the daughters are in \u201cfoster care for adults\u201d and are over stimulated by society\u2019s trends.  They were cautioned not to take them to a grocery store, yet go to a convenience store first to show the wide range of products.  The daughters did not know that they could summon help by dialing 911.  While trying to find placement for the sisters, officers informed them of the use of 911 and then informed dispatch that any calls from this address should trigger an immediate police response.  Before mom fell ill, she had tasks for the daughters to do.  The house became a large storage bin as items and food cans were stored in various areas.  Because the refrigerator was inoperable they stored chicken in the coldest part of the house, a back room, and then rotated other items needing to be kept cool.  Over the years the family paid a neighbor to mow the grass and shovel snow.  This neighbor never called police or social service for a simple \u201ccheck welfare\u201d call.  A lesson to take from this case is the very basic nature of a \u201ccheck welfare\u201d call that police routinely perform on a daily basis.  If someone suspects something out of the ordinary or are concerned for someone\u2019s safety, police are more than willing to verify their welfare.  It is our job.  The persistence and heartfelt concern of the officers, supervisor and social worker helped bring much needed aid and attention to these sisters who would not have known what to do.  They had called the private ambulance because they looked \u201cambulance\u201d up in the phonebook, not knowing of 911.  The 54 year-old female had never been in a car before and was actually excited to ride in one, a police car, to a group home.  Efforts will be made to keep the sisters together after they go through medical evaluations and mental health diagnosis.  Overall the sisters are reported to be in good spirits adapting to the outside world one step at a time.  This case illustrates three points.  If one wants to separate from the outside world, even in a city, it is possible.  Secondly, know your neighbors throughout the years you live next door.  Be aware of those nearby and question either to yourself or others if you haven\u2019t seen someone in weeks, months or even years.  Finally, police are more than willing to check on someone\u2019s welfare if you have suspicions.  While driving past the Holiday light exhibit at Olin Park, the sisters were mesmerized.",

As many as 50 students were coming or going to gym class at the time of the incident and many mistook the cap gun fire for real gunfire. This resulted in some initial panic. The cap gun is made of lime green plastic and evidently looks fake in good light. However many students only heard the rapports and did not see the actual gun. Officer's cited the student for disorderly conduct and left him in the custody of the school's principal.",

Both have been arrested but neither, at this point, has been tentatively charged with pulling the trigger.  The teens were located inside apartment #6 at 902 West Badger Road. Seized from the apartment was a flat screen television set that had been stolen from a Madison bar, and a large quantity of suspected drugs. Also recovered during a search of the building was a handgun. It had been stolen from a Madison residence during a burglary. ----------------------------------------------------(ORIGINAL RELEASE FEB. 7)Around 10:18 a.m. an off-duty Madison Police Detective was driving near the intersection of Badger Road and Cypress Way when the detective witnesses a shooting. There were two groups of young men involved. One group was gathered on one side of Cypress Way -- the other group was across the street. A member of one group pulled out a gun and fired several rounds across the road. One bullet struck an 18-year-old man. He was taken to a local hospital with a non-life threatening wound. The off-duty detective saw the gunman enter an apartment building located at the corner of Cypress and Badger Road. A perimeter was set up around the building. The Madison Police Department\u2019s Emergency Response Team (ERT) was called in. ERT members slowly and methodically cleared the building around 3:00 p.m. two persons of interest in the shooting incident were taken peacefully from an apartment. Following the shooting nearby Lincoln Elementary School was placed in \"lockdown\" which --for the students -- meant no outside recess. Other than that normal school activities took place during the ERT call up. Any potential threat to the community was diffused prior to the school day ending.",

The man was armed with a handgun and -- upon an officer\u2019s command \u2013 he dropped it into a snow bank. He allowed the MPD to search his residence and it was determined the suspect had fired several rounds into the ceiling and walls. One bullet appeared to have gone out of a window. Officers were not able to determine if that round had struck any nearby homes, but no injuries have been reported. The investigation revealed the suspect believed there had been intruders -- who turned out to be imaginary -- in his home. He was cooperative with officers and transported to a local medical facility.",

Officers learned a 6-year old male had been outside his residence when he was bitten by a pit bull being walked by a 9-year old child.  Apparently, prior to being bitten, the child became fearful of the animal and started to run away from it.  The pit bull was leashed but pursued the child, dragging the 9-year old along.  The pit bull bit the child in his right side area.  He received a minor bite wound.  City animal control will follow up.  It appears vaccination records of the pit bull are up to date.",

The Detective, in defense, kneed one of the pit bulls several times.  One pit bull bit the Detective's ankle.  The Detective, while fighting both pit bulls tripped and fell down.  One pit bull continued the attack by biting the Detective in the neck and head area.  The person who had let the dogs out tried to get the dogs off and was eventually successful.

                        "Details": "Shortly before 2:00 p.m. (August 8) the monkey was taken into custody in the downtown area. Animal Control Officers have placed it in quarantine for 10 days. The monkey's owner is a Madison woman, and she tells police she loaned the monkey to a friend last night. She also tells the MPD that the monkey is her service monkey, much like a service dog. The owner was on scene in the Dayton Street area, with police and animal control staff, to help bring the monkey in this afternoon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------On August 8th, around 4:45 a.m., Madison Police were dispatched to a local hospital reference an animal bite. A young woman told officers that she had been in the State Street area earlier. While walking near the beer garden area of State Street Brats the victim observed a man, inside the beer garden, who had a monkey on a leash. She further noticed that the man was allowing people to pet his monkey. So, she reached over the beer garden fence to do likewise. However, before she could pet the monkey, the primate bit her thumb. Officers who had responded to the hospital recalled that they had seen a man with a monkey on State Street around 2:15 a.m.  The monkey had been jumping up and down as 3 to 4 women were, once again, petting the monkey. At that point MPD had received no complaints about the monkey and no police action was taken. A treating physician says in light of the biting incident the monkey needs to be found so that it can be quarantined for 10 days to determine if it has any disease. Madison Police did put out an ATL (attempt to locate) around 6:30 a.m., and by 7:15 a.m. the man and his monkey had been found in the State Street area. An Animal Control Officer was to follow-up, but unfortunately the man somehow lost the handle on his monkey and it is now on the lam, presumably still in the State Street area.",

Fire from the soffit area had dropped down and also ignited some grilling materials below. The officer used a garden hose to extinguish the flames. Neighbors continued to be concerned that a child maybe in danger inside the home. The officer knocked down the home's door, and remained low as he swept through the home looking for family members. He ended up pulling three pet cats out of the house. Neighbors agreed to watch them while the Madison Fire Department inspected for other hot spots. The property's owner arrived to confirm no children were home. He, the property owner, indicated a bird's nest had been built next to his porch light, and the light likely ignited dried building materials left behind by the former residents.",

Dyhr saw there was smoke coming from the back of the house, and she began yelling for residents to get out. Officer Dyhr, with the help of fraternity members, was able to make sure all were evacuated. This took place in just a couple of crucial minutes prior to the arrival of Madison Fire. After the first evacuation, there was concern the fire could spread, and Officer Dyhr assisted in notifying and evacuating residents of neighboring buildings.

Officers learned that the driver was attempting to get his car out of his garage and got hung up on some garden equipment.  He had to pull forward to get off the equipment and at that point, the vehicle accelerated and crashed through the back wall of his garage and continued through two backyards until it crashed into the garage at 3818 Winnemac.  The back wall of the first garage was taken out, but it appears that the garage is stable.  The second garage that was struck has severe damage.",

The older brother, age 4, showed officers how he was able to climb up on a three-drawer storage cabinet to reach a shelf in his parents' bedroom. On that shelf were keys to his parents' SUV. It was parked in the driveway. Older bro than takes younger bro (age 2) outside for a bit of adventure (Mom thought they were just going into the playroom). The 4 year old then demonstrated for police how he was able to get into the SUV, put the keys in the ignition, start the vehicle, step on the brake, and pull the gearshift down into drive. When this happened, around 8:30 that morning, his mother heard a loud BANG. The SUV pushed the garage door forward, and then pushed a car that was parked in the garage into the house, causing significant damage to a wall. The mother, having heard the noise, hustled outside and was able to turn off the SUV and get the boys out safely. Madison police counseled the 4 year old about how he and his brother could have been seriously injured.",

On 2/7/07 Figueroa turned herself into the Dane County Jail, after having given her daughter to the girls grandmother. The grandmother was contacted by the Madison Police Department and arrangement made for the return of the girl to her father. The girl and her father have been reunited.

A struggle ensued and Seymour fled from the officer again.  The officer continued chasing Seymour and deployed O.C. spray to halt his behavior.

The vehicle was described at a 1996 Mercury Sable with Wisconsin registration, and had been taken by a Corey L. Reynolds (28 year old male of Madison).   Reynolds allegedly borrowed the car from the son of the registered owner on March 8th, 2006 in the early morning hours.  Reynolds never returned the car but it was seen in the Madison area days following March 8th.  Reynolds communicated to the son of the registered owner that he expected payment of $800 for expenses related to bail Reynolds had to post on a recent drug arrest.  Reynolds had associated the son of the registered owner of the stolen vehicle to that of his being incarcerated, and refused to return the car unless he was paid $800.00 in a quasi extortion scheme.The Chicago Police Department (Area One Homidice/Gangs/Sex Crimes) reported the 1996 Mercury Sable had been stopped in their city approximately 1:29a.m.,  just minutes after it had been reported stolen here in Madison.  When stopped, Reynolds stated the vehicle belonged to him but could not verify ownership.  Reynolds also claimed ownership of a clear plastic baggie containing what was believed to be Cocaine Base located on the front seat of stolen vehicle; citing he had just purchased it minutes before!   Reynolds was arrested on charges stemming out of being in possession of a stolen vehicle and drug possession.PO Howard Payne",

He assumed the perpetrators had taken off on foot, but then realized they must have taken his car, as it was gone. He had left the key in the vehicle so his nine-year-old son could listen to the radio. The 42-year-old immediately panicked realizing his boy was now inside a stolen car. He ran to the back of the service station and found his Cadillac -- both the drivers' and passenger doors were open -- and he could see two perpetrators running down Darbo Drive. The 42-year-old called police and tried to follow the thieves. As this was happening one the perpetrators approached the car and was able to deliver a blow to the 42-year-old through a partially open window.  The same perpetrator next kicked at the man's car, and then held on for a short distance (10 to 15 feet) as the 42-year-old tried to drive away.

Middleton Police are providing details to interested news media.Joel DeSpain---------------------------------------------On January 23 around 7:41 a.m. a North District Madison Police patrol officer heard dispatch announce that a 2004 black GMC Envoy had just been stolen from a driveway of a home in the 5300 block of Comanche Way. The officer recognized this as being the latest in a pattern of car thefts that have been on the rise ever since the mercury went down -- people are warming up their unlocked, unattended vehicles and thieves are taking advantage of the situation. Shortly before the Envoy was stolen, a '98 blue Ford Taurus was taken from a home in the same general area. Experience and training told the patrol officer that it was quite possible some young person had jumped in the Envoy and was perhaps taking a joyride to school or another destination. Armed with this knowledge the officer set up on one of the main arteries - Packers Avenue - to see if the Envoy might be come his way. It did. The officer attempted to stop the driver near McDonald's on Northport Drive. The perpetrator responded by gunning the Envoy's engine. The Envoy, which had been westbound on Northport, blew across the eastbound lanes before crashing into a snow bank. In those few quick seconds the officer saw two vehicles nearly strike the stolen SUV. Its driver sprinted away into a nearby apartment complex. Officers and a police dog were unable to track him down. Later, in the same area, a beige Mercury Sable was stolen. The three cases (the Taurus, Envoy, & Sable) are likely connected.In the wake of the crime spree North District Captain Cam McLay released the following statement: \"On January 23rd, there were 3 cars stolen between approximately 7am and 9am. The common thread in all of these cases was that the cars were left running to warm- up, and were unlocked and unattended. Madison Police officers spotted one of these vehicles and attempted to stop the suspect. The suspect was able to flee and avoid being taken into custody. Two of the three stolen cars have been recovered. This investigation continues at the present time, and we are confident that it will be solved.However, since January 1st, there have been 10 cars stolen in the City of Madison under similar circumstances. Nine of these occurred on the City\u2019s North side, and one on the East side.We are asking all residents to assure that they remain with their vehicles while warming them up, or minimally lock the doors and continue to monitor the vehicle from inside. These are thefts of opportunity, and are easily prevented by these simple steps.\"",

The caller said the driver of the stolen truck blew a red light and headed out Highway 51 to Anderson Street. The Chevy next turned onto Wright Street before stopping in the area of Commercial Avenue. The victim saw two young passengers flee on foot before the driver took off again. At this time officers were on the scene, and the two passengers lost in a foot chase.  They would not give up the name of their driver; however, the now parked SUV was recovered at N.

An Illinois man told officers he had left a '96 Geo Prizm he was driving unlocked -- with the key in the ignition -- while he went inside to pay for gas. He looked out to see a guy driving away in the Geo. The responding Madison Police officer put out -- over the radio -- an attempt to locate the Prizm. The transmission included a description of the thief. At nearby Cub Foods (4716 Verona Road) another Madison Police officer thought the description matched the guy he was just arresting for a retail theft. The officer -- who was at the Speedway -- drove over to Cub Foods and -- low and behold -- there was the stolen Prizm. The suspect would later make admissions against his penal interests.",

Paramedics and police officers tried to find the subject of the call but their efforts were initially unsuccessful. Upon returning to a parking lot at the rear of the apartment building paramedics were startled to see a man behind the wheel of their ambulance. A police officer ordered him to get out. He turned out to be the subject they had come to help. The police officer noted the man's eyes were red and his speech slurred. The man explained that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a good deal of allergy medicine. He said he got in the ambulance with hopes of driving himself to the hospital. He put the rig in gear and tried to drive away, but his plan bogged down as the ambulance became stuck in the large dump of snow. At that point he decided to just wait for the paramedics. This second plan turned out to be a better one as the first responders did take him to a hospital for observation.",

An Officer's squad also slid out and hit a tree, causing damage to the front end of the squad. The Officer received minor injuries and was treated and released.Officers took off after the passenger who was taken into custody at 3:21 pm. Officers set up a perimeter and the Dane County Sheriff's Office assisted with Deputies and a K9 unit. The driver was tracked to a townhouse on Wayridge Dr. where muddy footprints lead to a kicked in door. Warnings were given and Officers made entry, locating the combative suspect hiding in a closet. The suspect had dumped some of his muddy, wet clothes and had taken sweats from the residence. The suspect was arrested at 4:12 pm. The resident arrived home while Officers were present. The suspect had picked the address at random.",

The worker told a responding Madison Police Officer that it is protocol to leave keys in vehicles, as coworkers often need to move them around in order to keep the project moving along. One of these coworkers saw a guy driving the Silverado, with its emergency flashing lights on, out of the construction area on West Gilman Street. The truck was subsequently reported as stolen. By early afternoon a Clinton Police Officer in Rock County discovered the Silverado in her community and took into custody Mr. Richard Petrick \u2013 the man who had driven the truck there. The Madison Officer recognized the name right away. Mr. Petrick is someone the officer knows to have no permanent address, and is somebody who enjoys hanging out at Peace Park. In fact, the officer, that very morning, had seen Mr. Petrick sleeping on a Peace Park bench. The Madison Officer has spoken with Mr. Petrick in the past and has been told by Mr. Petrick that he has relatives in the Rock County area. It appears Mr. Petrick had taken the truck with hopes of visiting with some of those relatives. As a result of this incident Madison Police are recommending Mr. Petrick's name be added to the State Street ban list.",

Washington Ave.  Upon arrival, they located an 18 year old male who appeared to have overdosed on drugs.  The subject did respond to emergency treatment by Fire/Rescue personnel and was conveyed to a Madison hospital, where he is reported in stable condition.  It appears that this may well be a heroin overdose.  On May 24, 2006 there was a heroin overdose that resulted in a death.  This also occurred in downtown Madison.  There have been several other incidents with very similar concerns that remain under investigation.The Madison Police Department strongly cautions against using street drugs.  The person buying drugs never knows for sure what exactly the drugs contain or may have been diluted with.  Additionally, we strongly encourage anyone who observes a friend or acquaintance in distress related to the ingestion of street drugs immediately call 911 for emergency help.  Immediate medical assistance can save someone's life.",

Some in the group confessed that they had been out in the area, armed with green spray paint, and had scrawled graffiti on 2-parked vans, and 2 sheds.It should be noted that Graffiti is a City Ordinance violation. A 1st violation carries at $676 ticket. A 2nd ticket, within 5 years, will cost violators $991. Those penalties are for adults. Juveniles must make a mandatory court appearance at which time a judge will mete out the punishment.",

Whitney Way reference a Hispanic male that had exposed himself to a 16-year-old female that was walking on the sidewalk towards her residence.  After police responded, they determined at approximately 10:30PM the female was distracted while using her cell phone (sending text messages) and was approached by the male suspect asking if \u201cAnything was wrong & do you need a ride\u201d.  The female continued on her way but noticed that the male had exposed his genitalia.  The female told the suspect to \u201cGet away\u201d in a loud and convincing fashion, but that did not keep him from grabbing her buttocks.  The 16- year-old had no option but to defend herself, punched the suspect, and proceeded to run towards her residence.  Based on her keen observations, she did remember seeing a Grey colored van (possibly a Dodge Caravan \u2013 older model) passing her earlier before the suspect would later contact her.There were no injuries claimed in this scenario, but The Madison Police Department continues to ask citizens to pay particular attention to any suspicious persons or vehicles in their neighborhood.  This was a fortunate situation where no one was harmed, but we ask everyone to make sure they are not so involved with other tasks that they are not attentive to their environment.

This suspect had circled the neighborhood twice before stopping next to the female and asked, \"Do you need a ride - Are you sure\"?  The female did the appropriate thing and said \"No\" and continued to walk towards the school to safety.  The suspect at no point attempted to get out of his vehicle (Blue midsize vehicle in good condition, possibly a 2000 model with blue bumpers), but was persistent in asking if the juvenile female needed a ride.  This is being looked at as an enticement attempt and we are asking the community to be particularly observant of suspicious persons in their neighborhood.

When the boys asked to delete the picture the subject asked for their email address so he can send it to them.  The boys refused and eventually left the bus without further incident.  There was a delay in reporting this incident because the parents wanted to obtain more facts about the case first.",

Officers learned that the victim was walking on Raymond Rd, to McKenna Blvd when a male subject later identified as Lynch approached him.  The victim was walking on Raymond Rd when he noticed a book on the sidewalk.  The victim picked up the sexually explicit book and briefly looked at it.  Within minutes of picking up the book, Lynch pulled up in a white four-door vehicle and began to question the 15 year-old about desires to act out the images in the book.  The victim refused, threw the book to the ground and continued walking as Lynch left the area.  As the victim continued walking, Lynch circled in his vehicle.  The victim, who was now walking on McKenna Blvd closer to Elver Park, was fearful and tried to wave down a motorist to call police.   When this didn't work the victim found people in the Elver Park tennis courts and used their cell phone to call 9-1-1 as he felt he was being followed.  While on the phone, the victim noticed Lynch lurking across the roadway, staring at the victim.  By the time police arrived, Lynch was gone.  The alert victim did give police Lynch's license's plate number.  Lynch was arrested at his residence and taken to the Dane County Jail without incident.",

The boy was left in a running car while the older couple shopped for about ten minutes. Upon their return they found the boy sobbing, and holding his head in his hands. The boy reported that while he was alone an Asian male in a red car pulled in next to the car he was in. He says the suspect offered him a piece of candy, and he (the boy) feared the man was trying to take him. The boy was able to lock the car's door. His father says he is not the type of lad to make up such a story. The responding officer let the older brother know it is not a good idea to leave a child alone inside a parked, running car.",

At a couple of points in time the students say the man spoke to them through an open passenger's side window. First he told the girls, \"You guys are going to be late for school.\" Following this comment the students quickened their pace. The man in the car continued to follow slowly behind them. After another block or two the man said, \"I know your Dad, it's okay, I can give you a ride ... hop in.\" One of the girls replied, \"You don't know my Dad.\" They walked even more quickly eventually crossing from the south side of Raymond to the north side at Whitney Way where they cut in to the Walgreen's parking lot. They then observed the man in the car speed up and continue eastbound on Raymond. The girls immediately contacted a guidance counselor",

Madison Police Detectives, with assistance from agencies previously mentioned in the orginal incident report, will be investigating this case.---------------------------------(ORIGINAL RELEASE)At 1:53 p.m. Madison Police were called to the 10 block of East Main Street for a report of a suspicious package. A backpack was discovered hanging from a tree in front of the Walgreen Drug Store on the Capitol Square. This backpack had been on fire, and a U.S. Postal Carrier was able to put flames out utilizing a bottle of Gatorade. Madison Firefighters were called to the scene initially, and since that time more agencies have become involved in the investigation. Joining Madison Police and Fire are agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and members of the Dane County Sheriff's Department Bomb Squad. Bomb Squad leaders determined there is reason to be suspicious of items in or near the backpack, because of that - as a precaution - an area of the Capitol Square has been cordoned off. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. borders this area blocked to traffic on one side, while Main and King Streets mark the boundary on the other. Citizens are asked to stay away while the Bomb Squad can determine whether there is a real safety risk. Anyone who observed someone acting suspiciously in the area of the Capitol Square early this afternoon is urged to call Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.",

Construction workers observed Mr. Floyd attaching objects to a tree in front of the Walgreen's yesterday (see previous incident report), and were told by Madison Police Detectives to call immediately if they saw him again. They did see Mr. Floyd return to the Capitol Square, and he was quickly taken into custody. During this process Mr. Floyd threatened a Madison Police Detective with a straight-edged weapon.  Items of concern were found on Mr. Floyd's person, and on a bicycle that he was using. Because of this an area of the Capitol Square (between the Inn on the Park, and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.) has been shut down so the Dane County Bomb Squad could investigate these items. This process should not impact the Concert on the Square, and that festive gathering is on for tonight. One of the items Mr. Floyd is believed to have attached to the tree yesterday did appear to be some type of improvised explosive device. Whether or not it had any capability of actually exploding will be determined as its contents undergo forensic testing. Once again, the Madison Police Department would like to thank observant citizens - in this case the construction workers - for assistance in keeping Madison as safe as possible.-----------------------------------------------ORIGINAL RELEASEMPD Is currently investigating a suspicious package near this address on the Capital Square.

Officers found a 22-year-old woman near her infant child inside her apartment. She was bleeding from several self-inflicted wounds, and was now holding a knife over her head and pointing it at responding officers. She refused orders to drop the weapon, and instead stepped backward toward the infant who was on the floor in a bouncy chair. An electronic control device (the officer was using a taser brand ECD) was deployed and the suspect dropped the knife defusing the rapidly evolving situation before deadly force was needed to stop the threat. Earlier, the suspect was involved in a domestic fight. It escalated into the suicide attempt.",

It was learned the male was walking across the bay from the south end and nearly made it when he fell through the ice about 100 yards from Brittingham Park.  The male was taking a shortcut in his walk to work.  Fortunately as the man screamed for help, two ice fishermen heard him and called 911. The male dug a sharp instrument into the ice to prevent him from falling further into the water until rescuers arrived. Two Madison Firefighters wore their wetsuits and rescued the individual through the use of ropes and clamps.  The male was transported to a local hospital where his condition is unknown at this time.  He was in the water for approximately 15 minutes.  It is apparent that although cold temperatues exist, not all the ice is safe enough to walk on yet.",

An unknown male noticed the child in the car, which was not running and was unlocked, and brought him inside the bar.  Employees and the male were able to link the child to the mother (Brown) who had been going in and out of the bar checking on her son.

Williams was contacted and arrested on separate and unrelated charges.  Officers did find a security locked door that either had a malfunctioning lock or was not completely closed by residents of the building (entering or exiting).Residents of apartment buildings or single/multi-family dwellings should pay particular attention to security doors, and make sure they are securely locked when they enter or exit a building.

She says she left her door unlocked while running downstairs to do a load of laundry. When she returned to her residence she says her six-year-old son, and her two-year-old daughter were seated in the living room, both wide-eyed and staring into the kitchen. The mom looked that way and was shocked to see a stranger. She told officers he looked \"high\". The man ran her way. She punched him a few times, and also delivered a kick. The guy said nothing and ran off. The woman reports seeing him get into an older model maroon car. It sort of looked like a Ford Taurus to her. She said she waited to report the incident because she was shocked and unsure what to do. The responding officer advised her to immediately contact 911 in situations like this one.",

Mall staff had received a complaint from a woman who had been using the bathroom around 9:40 a.m. The woman was in a stall and observed a man peeping over the top of it from an adjoining stall. The employees decided to conduct a sting wherein a female staff member went into the bathroom and pretended to be \"using\" it. She was aware someone was in a stall, but she could not tell who it was. When the staff member rattled the toilet paper holder the suspect's head popped up above the stall. Startled, the employee ran out and informed a male colleague of her encounter. A few seconds later the suspect came running out of the restroom, and ran out an exit door. The employees chased the man eastbound on Tokay Boulevard, but lost him. One of the responding officers saw a suspect matching a description given by those who had been involved in the initial pursuit. The employees later identified him as the man who was peeping in the bathroom stall.",

A witness to the event stated she saw approximately three male subjects involved in kidnapping a person.  One of the suspects was holding a black semi-automatic handgun.  The witness stated the gunman made gestures to the victim to get into a dark colored car, and the vehicle pulled away.  Officers from the Madison Police Department checked the area in an exhaustive search to find the vehicle/victim, but nothing developed as a result of those initial efforts.  Upon further review by a Madison Police Detective, it was determined that there were additional facts that explained what really transpired.  A black handgun was recovered (Glock facsimile), and the investigation is continuing.Several students had in fact staged this entire event as part of a filming project, where they would duct tape an alleged victim and put him in the trunk of a vehicle at gun point.  This was allegedly a scenario done for entertainment purposes, and was done based on information regarding another incident occurring within our city where a kidnapping had been staged in the last year. The Madison Police Department does understand the academic value that a project of this nature might bring, but individuals that are thinking of involving themselves in projects such as this should notify the proper authorities (local police).  The public should also understand that without proper notification of such activities, people are subject to the risk of an adversarial contact with a responding police officer.  We want to maintain a harmonious relationship with the community, especially when it involves activities of academic enrichment.  We do not want police officers to be placed in a compromising position of making a deadly force decision when communication could have prevented any such problems.  PO Howard Payne",

A motorcyclist told officers the car had nearly hit him at the corner of State and Lake Streets just before it entered the lake.

The owner of \"psycho\" stated that the dog couldn\u2019t be restrained in the house, as he is too strong and would pull away from anything inside.  Once outside, the pit bull attacked the lab, biting it on the neck several times and bringing it to the ground multiple times.  The lab was taken to the emergency animal hospital for immediate care.

The officers observed that one of the front windows was broken out, yet the rest of the exterior was secure.  As officers entered the home they heard a noise in the kitchen.  As they approached the dark kitchen, an enormous bird flew at them and it turned out to be a wild turkey.  Officers came out of the house to compose themselves of what they learned . . . a viscous wild turkey was tormenting the house.  Officers reached an Animal Control Officer who stated that there have been a number of wild turkey complaints in Madison as it was mating season.  Animal Control advised to get a large blanket and coax the turkey from behind into leaving out the door.  That failed.  The turkey was standing in the corner of the room with its beak pressed into a corner and it didn\u2019t appear to be injured.  Now the bird was pecking its beak into the corner, relentlessly.  The officers obtained a small cup of water and threw it on the turkey\u2019s head, but it didn\u2019t move, only stopped pecking.  Officers then arranged furniture in the room to funnel the turkey out the door.  That failed because the turkey ran down the funnel, but continued upstairs.  The turkey went behind a couch in the study upstairs.  The officer did not want to continue to have the turkey damage the room to the large extent it had downstairs, so the officer used a taser to subdue it.  The first shock to the back of the turkey only froze it in place.  The turkey then flew around and broke the light fixture.  A second deployment of the taser worked as the turkey flew down the hallway, stairs and out the front door.",

Once officers arrived, they found a male victim who is a Madison resident.  The victim and witnesses told the police that approximately eight white males had exited from 621 E. Johnson St., pushed the victim to the ground and kicked him.  With this information the officers tried to make contact at 621 E. Johnson St. to identify suspects and/or witnesses.  The officers could hear a large party occurring inside the residence.  When officers attempted contact at the door, they were told to go away and that they could not come in.  No one answered the door to an obvious party inside.  The Central Community Police Team assisted Patrol Officers with the incident and subsequent investigation.  Residents were not cooperative with the investigation.  As a result of the investigation into the house party, a total of $54,000.00 in tickets were issued to the persons hosting the party.  The battery complaint remains under investigation.  The victim was treated by Madison Fire/Rescue and refused any further medical treatment.",

It was also reported that people were running out into the street playing \u201cChicken\u201d with the cars driving past.  A 16-year-old male from Madison was found passed out on a fence near this residence and had been consuming alcohol at this location.  He would later be transported to U.W.ER based on medical concerns of excessive alcohol consumption.  The 16 year old reported to officers that the party at 811 E. Gorham contained 50-100 James Madison Memorial Students and that there was at least one keg of beer in the party.Officers stood by at the residence for approximately 3 hours before a resident arrived home and gave them permission to enter.  The amount of time that was expended was based on information that Madison Officers had about juveniles on location that were in potential danger; with no responsible adult monitoring activities at the residence.  A number of Officers identified approximately 70 students from James Madison Memorial High School; all of which had been drinking in the party with the exception of only 9!   The names of the students involved will be shared with school officials.The adult throwing the party was Cindy A. Fraser, 21-year-old female from Madison.  Officers found three empty \u00bd barrels of beer in the house.  All activites were directed by a Madison Police Seargent of the Central Community Policing Team.  Hard work and resilient effort by all members of the Central CPT brought about proper investigation of this matter.  This investigation is ongoing, and charges/citations could be forthcoming as the Madison Police Department works with The City Attorney\u2019s Office on an appropriate course of action.PO Howard Payne",

                        "Details": "Following the initial press release Madison Police received a call from a Jefferson County Detective Sgt., and it appears the mystery of the quarters has been solved.It turns out a Loomis armored truck going from Milwaukee to Madison on July 23rd lost some of its load, and not all in one spot. The Jefferson County Det. Sgt. reports they responded to mile markers 270-271 of westbound I-94, just east of Johnson Creek, on the 24th of July following a tip from a semi-driver about a large number of quarters in- and along- the highway. The \"I\" had to be shut down as deputies, working a 100-yard long stretch of road, picked up the cash; some of which was in rolls, some of which was now loose. A total of $3,200 in quarters was recovered, and the Det. Sgt. reports $500 in quarters was destroyed from being hit by passing traffic. He says Loomis was cited for failure to prevent a leaking load. On the 29th of July the same Det. Sgt. reports an additional $199.75 (in quarters) was recovered (in Jefferson County) from along I-94 near mile marker 268 of the westbound lanes.Loomis reports a total of $8,000 was lost on the 23rd, and that $4,500 worth of quarters has been found for return to the company. ----------------------------------------------------------Madison Police are not offering a penny for citizen\u2019s thoughts, but are seeking help in solving a case involving hundreds of dollars in spilt quarters. Detectives do not know if they were stolen, or dropped, but they were discovered in two locations on consecutive days last month. First a fellow riding a bicycle called police shortly before 11:30 p.m. on July 23rd saying he had just spotted a large number of quarters on the roadway in the 4000 block of Commercial Ave. Many were in boxes, others were just scattered about. Those scattered about looked as if they had been packaged in rolls, but the rolls had likely burst after being run over. This first batch of quarters tallied $303.50. The very next day, on July 24th, around 5:35 a.m., a second batch of quarters was discovered at the intersection of N. Stoughton Road and Highway 30. These were also packaged in boxes and rolls similar to those recovered a night earlier. The tally with on this find was $499.75. The quarters - $803.50 worth - are now in an MPD property locker.",

Upon further inspection, Gerrits discovered that the paper was actually a large amount of cash bills.  He immediately got out of his vehicle, as he had been traveling westbound on East Washington Avenue between East Springs Drive and Zeier Road, to secure the currency.  He made sure the police were immediately contacted and stood by for their response.  Suddenly random vehicles started to stop at his location to make claims of the money.  One subject actually got out of his vehicle and approached Gerrits stating, \u201cI lost my money\u201d.  Gerrits remained calm and told this subject to standby for police and they would deal with his concern.  Gerrits advised that this subject immediately left the scene and never returned!  Just minutes later, a different vehicle would stop by this location and a female would approach the curbside where bills were still blowing in the wind & would grab some of the money from the ground.  Police would arrive on scene to secure $890.00 in cash.Many of the releases that are completed reflect negative situations that occur in our city daily, but Gerrits personified the very essence of what a \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d is all about.  Gerrits stood by with the funds and did the appropriate thing by contacting the police in this matter.  Gerrits placed himself in danger by way of vehicular traffic and concerns about individuals that wanted to make street-level claims of these funds that they had no right to.  All serial numbers were reflected from all bills recovered, and appropriate protocols will be followed with the security of the currency.PO Howard PayneMadison Police Department",

The woman said she was walking along East Wilson Street around 4:45 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon when she spotted something in the street - very near the curb. That something was a bundle of cash. The woman says another passerby had just gone strolled by the stack of 20-dollar bills, but evidently did not see it. She picked up the red rubber band bound wad and took it home to show her husband. They decided they should turn it over to authorities. A Madison Police officer sat down with the couple and counted the bills. There were 45. They looked fairly new. They were crisp. They did not have any dye on them that might indicate they were taken in a bank robbery - anything like that. The officer made the observation that drug money would not typically be in this type of order or condition. He praised the couple for their honesty and high ethical standards in bringing in the $1,000. They have asked to have their identities not made public.",

Swift thinking solved this problem:  A tow truck company was called in and they whisked away the 200 lb concrete life size BAMBI to MPD storage. . . oh, when does school ever resume???",

Several officers tried to help this stray horse, who ran away from her stable owners. The horse was in danger of colliding with vehicles. Officers chased the horse down Buckeye Rd toward Hwy 51 until losing site of it.  Eventually the horse was relocated on Acewood traveling to Buckeye; then was chased down Buckeye to the Town of Cottage Grove, to Hwy AB to the Beltline.  During the spectacle, officers and several citizens attempted to coral the horse with cars, but the horse slipped through each time.  A water life-saving device was also thrown in attempt to lasso the frightened, cold horse.  The owner of the horse followed police and the horse during the course of events.  Eventually with the help of citizens, the officers were able to coral the horse near Hwy 12/18 and Hwy N and return her to her rightful owner.  The horse suffered some minor injuries throughout the almost hour-long event.",

Witnesses told officers that the driver (later identified as Mr. Martinez-Garcia) of a white, 1996, Cutlass had been heading at a high rate of speed in the northbound lanes of John Nolen when he crossed over the median into the southbound lanes of John Nolen. According to witnesses a couple of southbound drivers were able to swerve and get out of the way of the Cutlass, but not the driver of a 2008 silver Honda. That driver (the victim listed above) was hit head-on. Inside the offending Cutlass Madison Police Officers discovered a large amount of car stereo equipment. One officer wrote that the back of Mr. Martinez-Garcia's vehicle was \"as full as Santa's sleigh.\" Also at the crash scene were three subjects who turned out to be victims of car break-ins. All live in an apartment complex on Moorland Road. Some neighbors, who live at that complex, were, around 5:00 a.m. that morning, were bearing witness to a series of car break-ins. Some victims of the break-ins became aware of what was happening.  Three men ran from their apartments to confront the suspects. The suspects made a hasty retreat, even leaving some stolen stereo speakers in the parking lot of the complex. They (the suspects) took off in the in the Cutlass, and the three apartment complex residents, who had originally thought to confront the suspects, decided to give chase, with hopes of jotting down the license plate of the Cutlass. They ended up being witnesses to the crash. Its believed Mr. Martinez-Garcia was aware that he was being followed by the victims.",

The officer pointed out the car in question had Iowa license plates. While frisking the suspect the officer detected two large, heavy items in his coat. The suspect suggested they were parts to his computer. Upon further review the \"parts\" turned out to be ski bindings. The officer asked Mr. Williams if he attached ski bindings to his computer. Mr. Williams stated that he did. The officer then located the owner of the Chevy Blazer that had been broken in to a short time earlier. That man identified several items found on the suspect including his sunglasses, his cell phone, and the ski bindings he had just purchased off of E-Bay.",

Investigators believe Mr. Davis may have been working in concert with at least one other individual; however they caution that other people, completely unrelated to Mr. Davis, may also be involved in what has become a national theft problem. In Madison alone a couple of hundred catalytic converters have been stolen since March of this year. The Madison Police Department, recognizing the trend, has implemented a plan to catch thieves.

She reports that while pushing the baby she came upon a guy who was 10 feet off of the bike trail. The victim says the man was naked, save for light blue, plaid boxer shorts that were hanging around his ankles. She indicates he was staring at her and masturbating. She then took off at a full sprint heading back toward Midvale Blvd. As she ran, she looked back, and observed that the man was now naked (no boxer shorts) and chasing her. She estimates during the 100 yard run he got as close as 15 feet from her before she arrived in the vicinity of Midvale Blvd. where there was traffic. It was at this point that she says the suspect stopped chasing and ran back into some woods.",

MPD detectives also executed a search warrant at Hirsch\u2019s S. Stoughton Road residence.  This action was based on information that was provided to the MPD by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Madison detectives learned that Hirsch was a subject of interest in the investigation of a commercial child exploitation website involving member-restricted access to at least 18 different child exploitation websites.  Hirsch is currently employed as an educational assistant for special education children at Waunakee Middle School. He formerly worked in a similar capacity at Madison La Follette High School.

One victim said she was actually \"grabbed\" twice by the suspect. The first assault happened as she and a group of friends were walking on State Street around 3:00 a.m. The second assault occurred twenty minutes later as she and a female friend were walking on Langdon Street. This victim told the suspect to knock it off that what he was doing was \"molestation.\" The suspect then began to follow the women, which caused them to become increasingly frightened. As they made their way into a residence they looked back and could see he was now pleasuring himself. They gave responding officers a good description of the suspect, which enabled officers to locate and arrest Mr. Ubaldo Xelhua-Jimenez.",

Responding officers could also hear the woman screaming, \"Get off of me!\"  Officers were prepared to force entry, but instead were greeted by the suspect who, from behind a closed door, told police he had a gun. He threatened to use it, and was refusing to come out of the home because he was aware of outstanding warrants for his arrest. Many were for outstanding child support. At the time of this dialogue there were three young children -- and their mother -- inside the dwelling. Police set up a perimeter and started negotiations. First the mother and one child were allowed to exit, and then a second child was freed. Around 3:20 a.m. negotiators were able to bring the entire situation to a peaceful conclusion as the suspect came out and was taken into custody. Officers discovered the children were living in very poor conditions. Proper authorities (a social worker etc.) were notified.",

                        "Details": "On April 22nd Madison Police received information about a hoax/scam that created a good deal of concern for a Madison man who was sent a threatening email Monday morning.The subject matter stated \"Matter of Urgent\". It was from the name \"Mr. G. Hord\" with an email address of axa@killer.com.The e-mail starts out stating, \u201cHello.  It\u2019s a pity that this is how your life is going to end soon as you don\u2019t comply.  As you can see there is no need of introducing myself to you because I don\u2019t have any business with you.  My duty, I am mailing you now, is just KILL you and I have to do it as I have already been paid for that.\u201dIt then goes on to state that a friend wants the man dead, and has already paid for the service. The entrepreneurial scammer writes the man can save his life, and get the \"hit\" canceled by forking over $3,000.The communiqu\u00e9 goes on to say,  \u201cIf you are not ready to take my help, then I will carry on with my job, straight up.\u201d  It says not to contact police or anyone or,  \u201cI will extend it to your family, in case I notice something funny.\u201d  A website that tracks urban legends - snopes.com - states the \"hit man bribe scam\" has been around since early 2006. Infact, the FBI (go to fbi.gov) has issued a couple of warnings over the last couple of years on its \"E-Scams & Warnings\" web page:(THE FOLLOWING IS WHAT CAN BE FOUND ON THE FBI WEBSITE)NEW TWIST CONCERNING THREAT AND EXTORTION E-MAILS 01/09/07\u2014There is a new twist to the IC3 alert posted on December 7, 2006 regarding e-mails claiming that the sender has been paid to kill the recipient and will cancel the contract on the recipient's life if that person pays a large sum of money. Now e-mails are surfacing that claim to be from the FBI in London. These e-mails note the following information: An individual was recently arrested for the murders of several United States and United Kingdom citizens in relation to this matter. The recipient's information was found on the subject identifying the recipient as the next victim. The recipient is requested to contact the FBI in London to assist with the investigation. It is not uncommon for an Internet fraud scheme to have the same overall intent but be transmitted containing variations in the e-mail content, e.g., different names, e-mail addresses, and/or agencies reportedly involved. See our related top story on the hitman scam. Please note, providing any personal information in response to an unsolicited e-mail can compromise your identity and open you to identity theft. If you have experienced this situation please notify the IC3 by filing a complaint at www.ic3.gov. Due to the threat of violence inherent in these extortion e-mails, if you receive an e-mail that contains personally identifiable information that might differentiate your e-mail from the general e-mail spam campaign, we encourage you to contact the police.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------E-MAILS CONTAINING THREATS AND EXTORTION12/07/06\u2014We have recently received information concerning spam e-mails threatening to assassinate the recipient unless the individual pays several thousand dollars to the sender of the e-mail. The subject claims to have been following the victim for some time and was supposedly hired to kill the victim by a friend of the victim. The subject threatens to carry out the assassination if the victim goes to the police and requests the victim to respond quickly and provide their telephone number. Warning! Providing any personal information can compromise your identify and open you to identity theft. If you have experienced this situation, please notify your local, state, or federal law enforcement agency immediately. Also, please notify the IC3 by filing a complaint at www.ic3.gov.",

The guard said that two young men had just jumped from the top of the terrace into Lake Monona, and that a boat had picked them up. He further explained that young people jumping from the roof was an ongoing problem. He said this is very dangerous and he was concerned someone was going to get seriously hurt. Madison Police got a description of the \"get-away\" boat and contacted the Dane County Sheriff's Department Lakes Patrol. Deputies were able to locate the boat and the two jumpers. Both were cooperative and apologetic saying they would never do this again. The young men also indicated they got the idea for the stunt from a friend's My Space page. There are signs in the area of the jump site that state, \u201cDanger No Trespassing Beyond Hand Rail.\u201d The signs also indicate that going beyond the rail is a violation of City Ordinance 23.07,  which is the trespassing ordinance.",

Armed with this knowledge an officer was observing the McDonald's and Mobil gas station parking lots, as well as the South Transfer Point around 4:00 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. While conducting this surveillance the officer saw a group of young men standing around a car that was parked at the fast food restaurant. After several minutes it became apparent that they were not there to buy food. The officer went to contact the subjects. One of them ran into and through the restaurant before fleeing out of a different door. He then darted into Park Street traffic causing cars to abruptly hit the brakes. With traffic now stopped the officer chased the suspect into the parking lot of a business (Comstock Firestone Tire) across the street from the McDonald's. A Dane County Sheriff's Deputy was in the area at the time of the foot chase and observed the suspect toss a plastic bag onto the roof of Comstock. The suspect, Mr. Martell Stamps, was then arrested by the deputy and the officer. The officer would later climb a tree and retrieve the tossed bag. It contained many \"rocks\" of crack cocaine. Police soon pulled over the car around which the young men had originally gathered. That traffic stop resulted in the additional arrest of a passenger who turned out to be Mr. Stamps' brother. The car's driver, Mr. Dushaun Mims was cited and released.",

Three female residents (all in their 20's) had each locked themselves in their respective bedrooms after a stranger had either entered, or tried to enter, the areas in which they slept. The roommates later explained that they were not sure they had locked their apartment door, and there was no sign of forced entry. However, when police arrived they found Mr. Daniel Smith sitting in the living room. Two of the three roommates said they had awoken to find Smith in their bedrooms. The third roommate said she had her bedroom door locked, but heard someone trying to open the door a couple of times.  It was determined that Mr. Smith had been drinking, and he had a difficult time explaining why he was in the apartment. To most questions asked by responding officers Mr. Smith responded, \"Chicken do.\" At one point he did say, \"I'll tell you what day it is, it's Tuesday.\" It should be noted this happened on a Friday.  Mr. Smith was arrested for Trespass, Disorderly Conduct, and Criminal Damage to Property after it was discovered he had urinated in his pants, and that urine was partially absorbed into the fabric of a futon he had been on while sitting/reclining in the women's living room. None of the roommates knew Mr. Smith. The MPD strongly urges residents to lock their doors.",

It was learned that as the victims were returning home and entering HWY 151 from the I-90 they may have unintentionally cut off another vehicle.  In doing so, the other vehicle described as possibly a gold or silver Buick Ranier SUV, followed very closely behind the victims, shining their headlights on and off.  Eventually the suspect vehicle pulled in front of the victim's car, while on American Parkway, causing the victims to stop.  The suspects got out of the car, confronted the victims and a fight ensued.  The victims suffered minor injuries to the head and sought medical attention on their own.  An independent witness observed this incident from afar and called the 911 Center.  No arrests have been made as this incident remains under investigation.  If anyone has information about this crime, they are encouraged to call Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.  Callers can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a cash reward.",

                        "Details": "In response to increased citizen complaints about vehicles with loud stereos and amplification (known as \"boom cars\") disturbing neighborhoods, Alder Judy Olson, the City Attorney's Office and the Madison Police Department have worked together in a problem-solving capacity. Neighborhood Officers and officers on the Community Police Teams have received training on writing citations to vehicles in which citizens complain that their amplification was disturbing.  The goal is for neighborhood groups to report to police those vehicles \"booming\" their stereos, disturbing the peace.  Trained Officers to this initiative will be available to present training to neighborhood association groups on what to observe and how to formally report these disturbances to police.  Neighborhood Associations or concerned citizens should contact their Police District Lieutenant to learn how to receive this training.  The citation issued holds the owner of the registered vehicle accountable if they are not the driver or in the vehicle.  The following is some information regarding the training and legalities of this problem-solving initiative:DISTURBANCE FROM VEHICLES WITH LOUD ELECTRONIC SOUND AMPLIFICATIONOften referred to as Boom Cars, police are seeing a rise in complaints from residents concerning vehicles which park, stand or operate with sound systems so loud, they disturb the peace. This is a difficult violation for police to address because of the transient nature of the incident, yet that does not diminish its negative effect on the quality of life for citizens in areas all over the city.Under what is known as the owner onus principle, the registered owner of a vehicle is liable for loud car stereo violations. Madison General Ordinances allow a citizen to file a written complaint in regard to radios or electronic sound amplification devises audible from a vehicle in excess of 75 feet. Police may issue citations to the vehicle owner regardless of who was operating at the time of the offense.This link will give citizens information on what they can do to be reporters. The law is quite specific in its scope and nature, and it is important that citizens carefully read the information and plan to do the necessary pre-work. USING THE CITIZEN COMPLAINT FORMThe citizen complaint will require you to do some work ahead of time. You will need to prepare a diagramming map with the report, and should make several copies of this ahead of time, since it will require taking measurements. You will also need to pick a place for making your observations, and you need to be able to clearly read the rear license plate of the vehicle from your observation point. The best way to handle this would be to enlist the help of other observers and complainants. It would not be possible to complete an honest report with just one person.To meet the legal criteria, you must identify the vehicle by license plate and description, and give some indications of the driver\u2019s description. The noise coming from the car must be electronic sound amplification and cannot be noise from a loud muffler or squealing tires. You must show that the electronic sound is audible for more than 75 feet, which will require you to measure out a distance from your home or business. The law has specific time lines that must be followed in order to produce a complaint. You must turn in your citizen report within 24 hours of when you made your observations. If you don\u2019t follow this time line, no citation can be issued. It only requires you to call police to pick up the form.",

He pointed out the suspect who was now hanging out in the park. The man was arrested on several tentative charges.",

The clerk at the store, where the victim tried to use the phony $20, was quickly able to tell it was a fake.

SUNDAY MORNING)Freakfest 2007 has just culminated and Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and Madison Police Chief Noble Wray want to thank the more than 34,000 who purchased tickets for the way they conducted themselves. Freakfest went extremely well, and another very positive step has been taken in making this a celebration for which the community can be proud. As of 2:00 a.m. 120 arrests had been made, most for alcohol violations.  That compares with 148 arrests during Freakfest 2006, and 334 that were made in 2005 during the Saturday night party.  Combining Friday and Saturday night arrests there were 175 this year compared to 235 in 2006.  No serious property damage or serious injuries were reported as of this writing, and it is hoped the event will continue to improve in 2008. For details, and interviews on Freakfest reporters are urged contact the promoter- Frank Productions. Again a big thanks to the UW students and other revelers who helped make this such a great success.--------------------------------------------------(THE FOLLOWING WAS RELEASED EARLY SATURDAY MORNING OCTOBER 27TH)It is early Saturday morning and Madison police have encountered few problems thus far in the night leading up to Freakfest. As of 1:00 a.m. 25 people have been arrested, most for unlawful possession of alcohol. Unlike the night before Freakfest last year State Street remains open this morning, and no area roads have had to be closed due to pedestrian traffic. Crowds on State Street have been described as \"thin\" by some in the command post. The most significant event for law enforcement and fire personnel was a battery to a couple of paramedics. They had picked up a drunken person who decided to throw a couple of punches inside the ambulance that was heading to a local hospital. There have also been concerns expressed by some law enforcement officers about the level of intoxication among some revelers. Several women, who appeared to be under the influence, were spotted walking alone in the campus area. That being said, Madison police are generally pleased with how the night before Freakfest has progressed thus far.",

The Madison police honor guard, and a contigent of  other officers will help escort Sgt. Brennan's body from Chicago to the Gunderson Funeral Home on Monona Drive. The media is invited to Gunderson's to photograph the arrival. A member of the MPD will also likely be available for an interview (away from the family). If you are interested in covering the motorcade and arrival, the OIC will try to post an updated release with a more specific time of arrival as it is a bit in flux at this hour. At the funeral home, media can look for Sgt. Jen Krueger-Favour, or Capt. Carl Gloede as they would likely be the ones who would decide who would be appropriate to speak with media representaives.",

He then entered the men's room and observed the violator seated on a toilet to the rear of the facility. The officer ordered the man out of the stall. Under questioning he admitted his preference for the women's room. The man explained the toilet seats are just so much more comfortable. He was told McDonald's management was not interested in his toilet seat preference, and did not want him on their property. The subject then announced his intention of buying a hamburger. The officer informed him he had no money, something the officer had noted during a pat down search. The gentleman left empty handed, and was then escorted away without incident.

Officer Fleischauer went inside and found there was a man (in his 20's) who was indeed hanging - by what appeared to be a bathrobe - from the banister. The man was losing consciousness. Officer Fleischauer hopped on a couch and lifted the man up to prevent further injury, and to try to open his airway. Officer Fleischauer was next able to get the man down from the banister, and the man did regain consciousness. Madison Fire Rescue arrived and the man was taken away for medical treatment. It\u2019s believed without Officer Fleischauer\u2019s quick actions the man would have been dead in a relatively short time. Officer Fleischauer will be nominated for a Madison Police Department Life Saving Award.",

There are but a couple of small pieces of aluminum parts on the bike. It has no brakes, and is a \"fixed\" gear. It does not coast, but works like a \"big wheel\". If you want to slow down you pedal backwards, or lock your knees. The owner says it would be useless to most riders.

Some were on foot and walking the Capitol Square near State Street when several passersby approached saying they had seen the guy, and that he appeared to be a bit out of it. An officer in a squad car radioed that he had a visual on the towel clad pedestrian. He had been spotted him near Bassett and Main Streets. One officer noted the \"man was staggering significantly as he walked, swaying from side-to-side and staggering a wobbly and crooked course from margin to margin of the sidewalk.\" It turned out he had boxer shorts on beneath the towel. When asked what he was doing the man said he was just on his way home. He does have a downtown address. He could not say why he was wandering around, where he had been, or where he had gotten the towel. At one point the man nearly fell over while talking with an officer. The officer grabbed him and placed him in protective custody. His clothes and wallet were later discovered on a table near the whirlpool area at the Inn on the Park. He was not a registered guest.",

A phone number she was supposed to call turned out to be bogus.On July 7th another Madison resident, who lives in the 200 block of East Bluff Street, received similar crank calls, including several that were collect from the Cook County Jail. The woman accepted one of the collect calls just to tell the caller he/she had the wrong number. It was at this point a male voice told her that she had a family member who had been involved in a serious crash and that the woman should call \u201cCaptain Smith\u201d. The prankster then supplied a phone number with a 312 area code.On July 10th a third Madison woman, who lives in the 1200 block of Iowa Drive, received four calls from \"Sergeant James\" asking her to call \u201cCaptain Smith\u201d at a given number because there had been a car crash involving an injured female. The victim called her daughters to make sure they were OK, and then reported the prank.The Madison Police Department has contacted the Cook County Jail and advised authorities of these incidents. Cook County deputies said they would attempt to track down the culprit and put an end to the annoying calls.",

Officers arrived shortly after 12:17am, and found a broken window that someone had thrown a beer keg through.  Several interviews were conducted at 753 East Johnson Street, and upon further investigation it would be determined that a nearby truck sustained similar glass damage.  The two incidents were definitely connected, and complainants gave officers on scene good descriptions of potential suspects.Officers would clear this scene, in order to respond to other priority calls, when just moments later a call to the 911 Center would advise of a \u201cFight in the street\u201d near Blair Street and Johnson Street.  The complainant stated there were approximately 20 people fighting.  Officers would respond to this area, which is close in proximity to 753 E. Johnson Street, and a foot pursuit would begin as officers would attempt to contact the participants in the fight.  The suspects would run through back yards, over fences, and soon thereafter be taken into custody by police on a number of charges.  This entire situation seems to have involve alcohol and an unresolved argument among several individuals at a birthday party which resulted in numerous fights and damage to property.  Another overriding factor was that there were many involved individuals in the disturbance that were not known to the residents at 753 E. Johnson Street.  As a reminder, it is always a best practice to have knowledge of all individuals you might have in your residence no matter what type of gathering you are hosting i.e., birthday party or graduation celebration, ...ect.  Keeping your property and the property of others safe is a paramount responsibility, but making sound decisions helps to prevent occurrences such as this from erupting.",
