                <p>
                    One thing near and dear to every Wisconsinite's heart is cheese, and considering
                    I am a geographer I couldn't help but map it. So here you have it, a map of cheese 
                    consumption per capita in europe.

                <h3>World Coffee Production and Consumption</h3>
                <p>Have you ever wondered where coffee comes from and who drinks the most of it?
                This map shows both the largest coffee producers and the largest coffee consumers.

                <h3>Map of Africa, Textbook Style</h3>
                <p>This is one of my favorite maps I've made. The design was inspired by 
                the maps I remember seeing in textbooks when I was a kid. Nothing lime that old 
                school textbook feel.</p>

                <h3>Sci-Fi Themed Mapbox Tiles</h3>
                <p>Inspired from my love of all things sci-fi, this tileset uses lots of oranges and reds 
                in an attempt to invoke a futuristic wasteland feeling.

                <h3>The Tour de Divide</h3>
                <p>I love biking and one of the coolest races I've ever heard of is the Tour de Divide. 
                While this map is not the exact route, it is one of my own design that closely follows 
                the great divide from the US Canada border to the US Mexico border.</p>

                <h3>Education and Income in Wisconsin</h3>
                <p>One thing I couldn't help but map is the relationship between educational 
                attainment and income levels. Note the relationship here. As they always 
                told me when I was a kid, be cool stay in school.</p>

                <p>In terms of things we take for granted, access to clean, safe water is one of them. This is infographic serves as a reality check reminding us not everyone has access to clean water.</p>
