                <h3>Cheese Map</h3>
                <p>
                    One thing near and dear to every Wisconsinite's heart is cheese. So I couldn't help but map it. Long story short, here is a map of cheese 
                    consumption per capita in europe.

                <h3>World Coffee Production and Consumption</h3>
                <p>Have you ever wondered where coffee comes from? What about who is drinking the most of it?
                This map shows both the largest coffee producers and the largest coffee consumers. 
                Enjoy it with a cup of joe.</p>

                <h3>Map of Africa, Textbook Style</h3>
                <p>My favorite map I've made. The design was inspired by 
                 maps I remember seeing in elementry school textbooks. There's nothing like that old 
                school textbook feel to bring back memories of when the world felt like a bigger place.</p>

                <h3>Sci-Fi Themed Mapbox Tiles</h3>
                <p>Inspired from my love of all things sci-fi. This tileset uses lots of oranges and reds 
                in an attempt to invoke a futuristic, possibly wasteland feeling, that's reminiscent of dune. </p>

                <h3>The Tour de Divide</h3>
                <p>I love biking and one of the coolest races I've ever heard of is the Tour de Divide. 
                While this map is not the exact route, it is one of my own design that closely follows 
                the great divide from the US Canada border to the US Mexico border.</p>

                <h3>Education and Income in Wisconsin</h3>
                <p>One thing I thought is interesting and deserves to be mapped is the relationship between educational 
                attainment and income levels. Note there is a correlaion here. As they always 
                told me when I was a kid, be cool and stay in school.</p>

                <h3>Dying of Thirst Infographic</h3>
                <p>In terms of things we take for granted, access to clean, safe water is one of them. This is infographic serves as a reality check reminding us not everyone has access to clean water.</p>
